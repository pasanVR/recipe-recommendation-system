1â„2 tsp onion powder
1â„2 tsp chili flakes

1â„3 cup panko bread crumbs ((optional, Don't use regular breadcrumbs instead))
Salt per taste
10 Mozzarella cubes
For breading and frying
Thick batter made with flour water and salt
Bread crumbs as needed
Oil for deep frying","Making filling and the balls
Mix everything except mozzarella cubes in the â€œfillingâ€ list together in a food processor until you get a crumbly paste. If you donâ€™t have a food processor, grind the habanero first in a mortar and pestle and add that to everything else and mix with your hands. Make sure to use kitchen gloves.
Make lime size balls. These do not have to be perfectly round. Now flat teach ball into a disc-like shape. Put a mozzarella cube in. Fold the edges of the disc inside and completely cover the mozzarella cube with the meat filling.
Roll between your palms to make it into a tight ball. No air should be left inside. Oil your hands if the filling sticks on to hands.The surface of the ball should be smooth. And the meat filling should cover the mozzarella cube completely. You can Make 10 balls out of the amount I have given above.
Breading:
Make a thick batter using some flour water and salt. Or you could use beaten eggs too. Arrange bread crumbs in a separate container. Then dip one ball at a time in the batter. Use a fork for this for easier handling. Then roll it on bread crumbs and cover the balls evenly. Gently press breadcrumbs with your hands to the ball to ensure that they stick to the ball. Do this to all the balls and lay them on a plate.
Do this breading process one more time with all the balls. Double coating is so important in this recipe.
Then arrange all the breaded balls on a plate with some space in between and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. This helps dry out the batter so the breadcrumbs adhere better to the meatball. This process also dries out the surface of the balls, which makes it quicker to fry.
Frying
Heat oil in a deep pan or fryer. Add a generous amount of oil for deep frying. Fry the chicken cheese balls until they are golden brown. Keep turning them frequently in the oil to get even browning.

1 1â„2 cup water, (you may need more)
1â„2 tsp salt
For breading and frying

a thick batter made with flour and water
bread crumbs as needed","Instructions
Make the filling

Grind the habaneros and green chili into a paste using your mortar and pestle. If you donâ€™t have one, cut it super finely. Please use kitchen gloves! this stuff is really hot! Definitely cut down the amount of habanero you use if you have kids or donâ€™t like hot food. Then mix everything together for the filling in a bowl. Or pulse a few times in a food processor.

Make the pancakes
Whisk flour, milk, and water together to form a smooth batter. If the batter is thick, add more water, a little at a time, and whisk. There should be no lumps in the batter. You can use a blender to mix this too. Heat a small nonstick pan. I use a nonstick hopper pan. add a drop of oil and rub it all over the pan using a paper towel. you just need a super-thin coating of oil. Pour the batter using a large spoon or a ladle and swirl the pan in a circular motion so the batter can spread throughout the pan evenly. Pancake has to be very thin so donâ€™t put too much batter. Cover and cook for about a minute until itâ€™s cooked but still flexible. Do not wait until they get crispy. (If you got any leftover pancake batter, do not throw away. Use it for Breading.)
Wrap the rolls
Now put the pancake on a plate. Put about 3 tbsp of filling and fold three side edges to the middle and roll it over to make a cylindrical shape roll. Make sure you dust with some flour to avoid them from sticking together. Go to my fish rolls recipe to see the step by step photos on wrapping.
Breading
Dip a roll in the batter, lift and let the excess batter fall back in and then place in the breadcrumbs. Use tongs for easy handling. Cover well with breadcrumbs. Put on a clean dry plate. Do this to one roll at a time. Repeat the breading process one more time. Since you put cheese in the filling it's important to have a nice thick coating. After double-breading, put them in the fridge to dry out for about two hours or so. This dries out the batter you used for breading which ensures they keep in place. You can fry them whenever you want. But make sure they are nicely dried.
Frying
Heat oil in a deep fryer or in a pan. When the oil is hot, fry rolls until they are golden brown. You have to fry them as quickly as possible to avoid bursting. Make sure you flip them frequently. And donâ€™t overcrowd the pan. I only fry about two rolls at a time. Serve hot when the cheese inside is still soft and melted.",['chicken potatoes cheddar cheese habanero green chili garlic powder onion powder chili akes salt needed Pancake batter milk water'],"2 cup finely shredded chicken

Use about a tsp of water at a time if only itâ€™s hard to grind. Otherwise no need to add any extra water. Mix the ground urad dal with rice flour and all-purpose flour. It would become a little stiff but a smooth paste. If the mixture is very dry and hard to mix add about tbsp of water and mix well. Cover with plastic wrap. Let the batter ferments for 12 hours or so until you see it has tiny bubbles/holes in it.If you live in a colder climate, turn on the oven light and leave it in the oven for 12 hours. DO NOT turn the oven on.After the batter is fermented, add salt to the mixture and coconut cream one tablespoon at a time and make it into a pipable paste. Do not over-mix since you can lose the air bubbles in the batter. In case it looks flat and no air in the batter leave it for about an hour before you pipe them into hot oil. Itâ€™s important not to add too much coconut milk since it would be hard for you to get the coil shape with a runny batter.Make the sugar syrup by heating dark brown sugar, water, and salt in a saucepan.

Now spatchcock the chicken. First, flip the chicken, breast-side down. Using kitchen shears cut and remove the backbone of the chicken. Now put a small cut on breast bone using your knife. Flip the bird back to the breast side up. Gently press on the breast bone using your palms to make the chicken flat. Pat dry the chicken using tissues. You need dry skin to get it crispy.
If you have time, definitely apply salt and leave the chicken in the fridge for up to 24 hours. Youâ€™d notice a significant difference in taste when you brine the chicken ahead of time. If you donâ€™t have time then thatâ€™s okay too. This chicken is still delicious.
Now prepare the paste. Grind everything together in a grinder or in a food processor. Taste a teeny tiny bit. This stuff is hot but itâ€™s good to check for salt.
Then apply the paste all over the chicken. If you did not brine it before sprinkle more salt over the chicken. Use kitchen gloves.
Peel and cut some potatoes. Salt them a little bit and add them to the cast iron skillet. (or any other large baking pan you have). Also, add some unpeeled garlic cloves. Now place the chicken on top of those potatoes.
Preheat the oven to 425F/ 220C. Bake the chicken for 45mins or until itâ€™s done. (If you have an instant thermometer, insert it to the thickest part of the bird.

Mix everything in the mixer for 10 mins or more until you get the window pane. (If you hand knead, double the time)
Take the dough out of the mixing bowl. Make it into a rough ball and put the dough back into the bowl, cover and let it rise until itâ€™s doubled in size. This would take roughly 1hr - 11/2hrs depending on the temperature of your house.
When doubled, lightly punch the dough. Take the dough out. Divide into 3 equal portions if you are making 3 small loaves. Or you can make one regular bread loaf with this amount.
Make the dough into a ball and flatten it out to a dish shape. Put the filling in. Or you can make these without a filling too. Now fold the left side to the middle with a slight angle. Fold the right side to the middle, the same way. This should look more like a narrow triangle. Now roll the dough from the narrow side to the wider side to form a cylinder. (please watch the video)
Pull the dough to your side to tight up the skin. (optional step but this is the step that gives the smooth crust on the top)
Oil the bread pan. Place the shaped dough in the bread pan.
Now let it rise again until it rises up 1inch above the bread pan. It would take about 30min - 45mins approx.
Meanwhile, put a separate baking dish in the oven. preheat the oven to 400F. When the oven is ready, add some hot water to the preheated baking pan. The idea is to incorporate some steam in the first few minutes of baking the bread. It helps you to get a good oven rise and a good crust. Put the bread pans in.

For this recipe, youâ€™re going to make the tempered lentil curry first. If itâ€™s not in a heavy bottom pot already, put the curry into a heavy bottom pot. Itâ€™s important that you use a pot that can retain heat after you turn off the heat. A clay pot or a cast iron dutch oven would be ideal. Now cook the curry in the lowest setting for about 20 - 30 mins uncovered, until it gets very thick. The time may vary depending on the heat level and your pot. So be watchful and check on it from time to time. Make sure to stir occasionally to avoid burning. When the curry is very thick, leave it uncovered for about 15 mins to settle down. It gets thicker when it cools down.

Cut the ends of the lotus roots. Wash it thoroughly to remove any mud or impurities. And peel or scrape the skin off. Then cut the lotus roots into very thin slices. Probably about 1mm to 2mm thin. If you cut them thinner they would cook a lot quicker. Wash the slices to remove excess starch.
Now add all the lotus root slices to a bowl and add some water. Mix about a tsp of salt and a tsp vinegar to the mix. This would help to remove some of the germs. (optional step, you can skip if you want)
Heat 2 tsp oil in a pot. Add mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds.
When the mustard seeds start to splatter, add curry leaves, dried red chilies (broken and seeds removed). Mix for few seconds until chilies start to brown a little bit.
Now add chopped onion, garlic, piece of garcinia cambogia (goraka) and let it cook until the onions start to sweat.
For that, add curry powder, chili powder (you can skip or reduce the amount of chili powder you add according to your likings.) and turmeric powder and salt to your taste. roast the spices in oil, continuously mixing.
Now add the lotus root slices (without the salt-vinegar water) and mix well with the spice mixture.
When everything is nicely mixed together, add very thin coconut milk or water to cover all the lotus root slices. Put the lid on and cook until lotus root slices are tender. ( You might need more or less than one cup.) If you use canned coconut milk, mix about 1 1/2 tbsp with water to make thin coconut milk. If you use freshly squeezed coconut milk, then use the third or fourth squeeze.
Halfway through the cooking, taste the broth and see if it's sour and salty enough. You can remove the Garcinia/Goraka piece at this moment if you can already taste enough sourness from the curry. Don't wait too long since you only need to add a hint of sourness. Also, adjust salt if needed. Cover again and cook, until you get a little to 1/4 cup of broth left or until the lotus root slices are tender. If the pieces aren't tender yet, you can add some water and cook a bit more longer. (Keep in mind that lotus roots always have some bite to them so you cannot get them super soft.)

Make the filling
Heat a tbsp of coconut oil. Add chopped garlic, chopped onion, green chilies and fry until onions get sweaty. Then add the diced carrot and some salt. Cook on medium until carrots are cooked all the way through. Then move the veggies to a side of the pan and add the chili flakes. mix and toast a bit and add the onion and carrot mixture. Add your potatoes. stir fry a bit and add the drained tuna. (You can use canned mackerel too but the taste and smell would be different.) Break with the spoon and stirfry for about a minute. Add the chopped leeks. Mix and well. If you feel like the mixture is too dry, add about a tsp of water and stir. Turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool down.
Making the pancakes
Whisk flour water and salt together and make a smooth somewhat thin batter (a little thinner than heavy whipping cream). You can use your blender too to mix the batter.
Heat a nonstick skillet or nonstick hopper pan (which is what I use). Brush a thin coating of oil using a paper tissue. Add about 1/3 cup of batter and swirl the pan to spread it evenly. Cook for about 30seconds to a minute or until it's cooked all the way through. (cover the pan if you use a nonstick hopper pan. If you feel like the pancakes are thick and not flexible, add a bit of water, a tbsp at a time, and thin it out. What you need is a very thin and flexible pancake.
Carefully transfer the pancake into a plate. Do not flip. Add 3 - 4 tbsp of filling in the middle. Also, place half of a boiled egg on the top. If you can roughly arrange the filling as a triangle, it would be easier in the next step. (Meanwhile, you can make another pancake too. Then you can do this whole process like a production line)
Fold from three corners to the middle to make it into a triangle. Check out the photo. Try not to leave much air inside the roll when you fold it. (why? read the tips on the recipe description)
Dust a tray/plate with flour and place the roll. Do this whole process to all the rolls. Do not stack them.
Coating
add a cup of flour and a little less than a cup of water, and a bit of salt to a bowl and make another batter. If you have any leftover batter from the pancake making, you can use the same batter for coating too. Also, put breadcrumbs into a plate.
Now using tongs or one hand, dip one egg roll in the batter. And lift and hold it to remove any excess dripping batter. Transfer the eggroll to the breadcrumb plate, and coat well with breadcrumbs. Lift the roll and shake to remove any excess breadcrumbs and pat with your hand so that breadcrumbs stick to the pancake very well. Place it back on the tray/plate. If the breadcrumbs you're using are very fine and powdery, do this coating process one more time to double coat the egg rolls.
Now if you have time, refrigerate the egg rolls in the fridge for about an hour or up until you're ready to fry them. If you're out of time, at least let them rest until the batter you use to coat dries out. As the batter dries out, the breadcrumbs stick to the pancake pretty nicely.
Heat oil in a deep vessel/pot. put a piece of a batter+breadcrumb piece and see if it floats immediately. If it floats then the oil is ready. Fry the egg rolls in hot oil. Make sure to flip them frequently to ensure even heat distribution. Also, be generous with the oil. Do not overcrowd the pan as the rolls drop the oil temp significantly. And add one roll at a time and let it fry for about 30 seconds before you add the next one. Put them on a paper towel after frying to remove excess water. Let them cool down on a cooling rack if you want to keep them crispy for longer.",['ned tuna drained cloves garlic onion green chilies carrot diced potatoes and into chunks leeks chili akes black pepper salt taste oil eggs'],"Ingredients

Make the filling
Heat 1 tbsp of coconut oil in a nonstick pan. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds.
When the mustard seeds start to splatter, add finely chopped curry leaves, finely chopped onions, thinly sliced green chilies, and salt. Mix well and let it cook until the onions get sweaty.
Lower the heat. Add chili powder, chili flakes, and turmeric powder. Mix well. This filling is quite hot so reduce the amount of chilies if you cannot handle the heat.
Add the roughly mashed potatoes. Mix well until everything combines together.
Add your sliced leeks. Mix on high heat. Do a taste test. Sprinkle and mix salt if needed. Turn off the heat.
Change it to another dish and let it cool down before you use it in the filing.
Make the dough and first rise
Warm your milk just a little bit. you should be able to dip your finger comfortably in the milk. Too hot, you can kill your yeast. Add the milk mixture to the mixer bowl. Add sugar and sprinkle instant dry yeast on to the surface of the milk. mix a little bit. If you're 100% sure your instant dry yeast is new and good, you can skip this test and mix all the dough ingredients together. If you use active dry yeast, then definitely activate it using warm milk as I have mentioned above, before you mix the dough. Let the mixture sit there for 2- 5 mins. You should be able to see the pieces of yeast mix float on the milk. And also tiny frothy pieces that have tiny bubbles.
Now add softened (almost melted) butter, salt, and flour.
Knead the dough in the mixer for about 10 mins until the dough is smooth and stretchy. If the dough seems dry and hard, and a tiny bit of water, about a tsp at a time. (Some flour brands absorb more water than others) The dough has to be nonstick, smooth, stretchy, and pliable. If you hand knead this, knead about 20mins or until you get a cohesive, nonstick smooth and stretchy dough.
Take the dough out from the mixer bowl, knead for a minute and shape it to a ball. lightly grease a bowl with some butter. Place the dough, seam-side down. Cover with a plastic wrap
Let the dough rise until it's doubled in size.
Stuffing, shaping buns and second rise
When the dough has doubled in size, remove the plastic wrap, and punch it down to remove the air.
Take the dough out to the counter. Divide the dough into 8 equal size portions.
Now take one piece at a time, shape it to a ball, and put it on the counter, seam side down, and cover with a plastic wrap.
Do this to all the dough pieces. Keep all the dough balls covered all the time. Always arrange the balls in order. Now take the first ball out.
Flip the dough ball. So the smooth side of the dough ball goes down and the seam side is up. flat it out to make a disk that is about 4 inches in diameter.
Put the filling in. Take the edges of the disk to the middle. And pinch those ends together tightly so they won't open up in the oven.
Flip the filled dough, so the seams are down again and the smooth side is up. Gently shape it to a round perfect ball.
Put it on the baking sheet and cover with a plastic wrap. Repeat this process with all the balls.
Let the filled dough balls rise again about 50% - 75% of their size. This won't take time as much as it took for the first rise. For me, it usually takes about 30mins. This could be vary depending on the temperature of your house. Do not let them rise too much, they will collapse in the oven and you'll get wrinkles on the top, and buns would be dry. IF they haven't risen enough, then the buns would be dense and tough.
Also, turn on the oven to preheat to 400F.
Egg wash and baking
Make an egg -wash by mixing 1 egg yolk and 1 tbsp of milk together. If you want to keep this vegetarian, you can use melted butter or milk for this. Now coat the buns with the egg wash using a brush. Coat twice if you like the buns a little darker.
Sprinkle with sesame seeds. (optional) Bake in a preheated oven. 400F temp for approximately 12 mins. Let them cool down for at least 30mins before you serve them.",['and roughly potatoes Leek onion green chilies spring curry leaves'],"Ingredients

1â„4 tsp garlic powder (optional)
1â„2 cup water
Other ingredients
1.5 lb Tuna fish
3 sprigs curry leaves
few ceylon cinnamon pieces (about 12)","Instructions
Mix Garcinia Cambogia, black pepper, salt, chili powder and garlic powder. Add half a cup of water and make it to a thick batter-like paste. You might need to add or reduce the amount of water you have to add to get the right consistency.
Cut the tuna pieces into somewhat thin and flat pieces. I like my fish pieces a bit smaller, so mine are about 3 inches wide and 1 inch thick.
Now apply a thin coating of oil to your clay pot. (if you don't have a clay pot use any other heavy bottom skillet that takes longer to cool down). This makes sure that pieces aren't going to stick to the pot. And also it roasts the fish pieces a little bit, which adds a nice roasted flavor.
Then dip one piece into the Ambul Thiyal batter and cover it very well with the Ambul Thiyal paste. Now place it in the clay pot. wider side down.
Do the same with all the pieces, one at a time and, arrange then into one layer. Every fish piece has to touch the bottom. If one pan is not enough to arrange all the pieces, then use another pan. Do not stack the fish pieces. For 1.5lb fish, you probably would need to use two pots/pans.
Now if there's any Ambul Thiyal paste left, you can spread it over fish pieces. Add some curry leaves and Ceylon cinnamon pieces. (Ceylon cinnamon comes as a roll of few cinnamon barks. Break it and use it)
Cover and cook on very low heat until the fish pieces oozes out water and they're mostly cooked. At this point, you can taste the liquid and decide if you want to add any more salt. I like to turn all the pieces upside down. You can totally skip this process if you want. Carefully lift each piece using a fork or spoon and turn them, one piece at a time.
Reduce the heat to the lowest setting, and cook until all the water is evaporated. Let them completely cool down in the pot before you store it. There should be no moisture left when it cools down. The low moisture helps to keep fish Ambul Thiyal pieces longer without going bad.",['make ambul thiyal paste garcinia cambogia paste freshly crushed black pepper salt red chili powder garlic powder water ingredients Tuna fish sprigs curry leaves few ceylon cinnamon'],"Ingredients

Trim the stems. Slit all the banana peppers/ capsicum into four using a small knife. Remove seeds if you don't like heat.
Mix turmeric, curry powder, sugar, salt, mustard powder, vinegar, oil, and Maldive fish flakes with Banana peppers. All the banana peppers should coat with spices. Use your hands to mix. If the peppers are hot, then don't forget to use gloves.
Add chopped onion or shallots and mix well again. Arrange the banana peppers into one layer. All the peppers should touch the bottom of the pan.
Turn on the heat, and sear the peppers until they get some brown spots. Do not stir. Using a fork or tongs, turn all the banana peppers and let them sear again for a few minutes. Do not use very high heat as it can burn the spices. If you see water oozing out of the banana peppers, then turn the heat high and let it cook uncovered until all the water is gone. Then sear again to get the brown spots on medium-low heat. If you feel like it's too dry and burning, add a bit more oil.
Then add half a cup of thick coconut milk and gently mix with banana peppers.
Let the curry cook a bit in medium-low heat. Taste the gravy. Adjust salt if needed. If it tastes vinegary or sour, add more sugar to balance the flavors.
Let it cook on low heat until you get the desired amount of gravy. Gently stir and turn the capsicums for even cooking. If the coconut milk seems boiling, then pick up the pot, swirl it for a couple of times, reduce the heat and put it back on the stove. If you need more gravy, you can add more coconut milk too.

2 tbsp thinly sliced shallot/onion
1 green chili (optional)
1 sprig curry leaves (thinly sliced)
water as needed (room temp)
salt as needed","Instructions
Put the shredded coconut into a large bowl. Add softened butter, thinly sliced onion/shallot, green chili, sliced curry leaves, and salt. crush and mix well with your hands. Taste. It should taste a little salty. If not add a bit more salt and mix again. ( The basic coconut roti only needs coconut, flour, water, and salt. You can skip all the other ingredients or use some but they add really good flavors)
Add flour to the mix and carefully mix the flour with coconut mixture to coat all the coconut with flour. You can just run your fingers in a circular motion to mix them. no need to knead.
Then add water, a little by little and gently mix with your fingers to make big lumps.
When you enough water to foam some big lumps them knead the dough for about two minutes. No need to be vigorous like you make other bread varieties. You only need to make a pliable, nonsticky dough. It doesn't have to be smooth.
Now divide the dough into 6 equal balls. If you want smaller Rotis divide the dough to 8 balls.
Using your two hands, make them into a round ball. One at a time. With this amount, you can make 6 balls. Keep them covered until you make them. (see the description for storing/freezing options)
Now, on a clean flat surface, apply some coconut oil. You can a flat plate, a tray, a banana leaf, or even your clean countertop. Put one ball in, flat it out until you get about 3/4cm to 1cm thickness. Don't make it too thin, the Rotis would dry out and turn into a biscuity texture. If you roll them thick, then you might end up with a raw middle.
Heat a roti pan, or a cast-iron skillet (these are the best options but any other pan would also work). Lay a roti and cook about a minute or until you get nice char marks.
Then flip and cook again until it's cooked all the way through. When it's done transfer into a cooling rack. While one roti is cooking you can flat out the next roti.",['fresh grated coconut all butter thinly shallotonion green chili sprig curry leaves water needed salt needed'],"Ingredients

1 thumb size piece of ginger
4 cloves
4 cardamom

Other
600 g chicken drumsticks or cut up bone-in chicken
2 sprigs of curry leaves
1 small Pandan lef broken into pieces
1 lemongrass crushed a little bit (use only about 4 inches of the tender part)
1 cup thinned coconut milk ((1 coconut milk : 3 water ratio))","Instructions
Make tamarind pulp:

Add your tamarind to a small bowl and add about 3 tbsp of water. Let it soak for about five mins. It would be quicker if you use warm water. Dissolve the tamarind in water using your fingers. Discard any seeds. I use seedless tamarind from a block but can be substituted with fresh tamarind with seeds, tamarind paste, or pulp.

Roast coconut and spices:

Roast your fresh coconut in medium-low heat until they become dark brown and aromatic. Keep stirring continuously to ensure even cooking. As soon as they turn dark brown transfer them into the grinder cup or a different pan. (Highly recommend reading the tips I have given above in the description)

Now add black pepper, cardamom, and cloves to the same pan and roast for about 30-45 seconds so theyâ€™re easier to grind. Add them to the grinder cup.

In the same pan, add chili powder and about Â½ tsp of salt and slowly roast it until they become darker in color. (read the given tips in the description for more info). Add that to the grinder cup. If you already have roasted chili powder or smoked paprika in hand, you can use that instead.

Make the paste:

Add all the ingredients Iâ€™ve mentioned under curry paste in the ingredients list above. Which are roasted coconut, roasted chili powder, roasted Sri Lankan curry powder, cinnamon powder (if you donâ€™t have this, add a piece of cinnamon directly to the curry without grinding) garlic, ginger, cloves, cardamom, black pepper, tamarind pulp, sugar, vinegar, salt, and enough water for your grinder/blender to work. Grind it into a smooth paste.

Taste the paste. It should already taste good. And has to be a little extra salty, sour, and should have some sweetness too. If not you can add a little bit more salt, vinegar, or sugar to match your taste. You are also going to adjust these flavors halfway through as you cook the curry.

Make the curry:

To a clay pot or any pot with a heavy bottom (such as a cast-iron dutch oven or heavy stainless steel pan) add your chicken, the curry paste, Curry leaves, Pandan leaves, finely chopped onions, a 3-inch piece of lemongrass (I didn't have this ingredient at the time, unfortunately) and salt if needed.

Add thinned coconut milk (dilute approximately 1 part thick/canned coconut milk: 3 part water ratio) to the pot and mix well together.

Cover and cook for 20 on medium low heat. After 20 mins taste and adjust salt, vinegar, and sugar to your taste. If itâ€™s too sour then add a little bit of sugar and if itâ€™s too sweet for your liking add a touch of vinegar to balance it out.

Now cook it uncovered on low heat for about another 30 - 40 mins or until the gravy has thickened. Do not mix with a spoon. Whenever you feel like the bottom is getting dry, then shake the pot a little bit. Cooking in low heat is the key to getting the gravy dark and thick and chicken to become very tender. It would get thicker as it cools down.",['curry paste Fresh grated coconut chili powder roasted Sri Lankan curry powder cloves garlic thumb size ginger cloves cardamom black peppercorns vinegar sugar tamarind seedless cinnamon powder salt taste chicken drum cut bonein chicken sprigs curry leaves Pandan lef broken into lemongrass crushed little bit thinned coconut milk'],"Ingredients

Add cardamom pods* and cloves into the mortar and pestle. Crush them until they become a coarse powder. Remove cardamom shells if necessary. Add ginger and garlic cloves. Crush them into a rough paste. (do not make it into a smooth paste. It can burn quickly in the instant pot)

Turn on the saute mode in your instant pot, and set the temperature to medium. Heat butter. Add cinnamon stick, whole black peppercorns, curry leaves, and pandan leaves. Saute for a few seconds. Then add onions. Cook onions until they become sweaty. Then add the ginger garlic spice paste you just made. Saute until they become light brown on the edges. (add a touch of water if you feel like the mixture is sticking too much to the pot)

Then add turmeric powder and salt (you get the chance to adjust the salt in a later step). Add chicken pieces in. Saute for about 30 seconds.Â 

Add water. Cover the pot. Pressure cook on high pressure for 8 mins. (Turn on the pressure cook mode. Select high pressure and adjust the timer to 8 mins and press start.)

When the timer is up, let the pressure release naturally. Open the lid. Remove chicken pieces to a separate plate using tongs.

Add washed-drained rice and coconut milk to the instant pot. Mix. Taste the broth and it should taste salty. if not add a little bit more salt. Close the lid and press the ""rice"" button or pressure cook on low pressure for 12 minutes.

Stir-frying vegetables and mixing with rice
Do these steps while the rice is cooking.

Meanwhile, heat butter in a frying pan or a small wok. When butter is melted add carrot and green beans. When they become tender, turn off the heat. Add leeks and salt to your taste. Saute. The residual heat is enough to cook leeks.

When the rice is done, let the pressure release naturally. Add the vegetable stir-fry to the instant pot. Mix everything gently without breaking the rice grains.Â 

Air-frying chicken

Pre-heat the air-fryer to 400F for about 6 mins.Â 

Sprinkle salt and add lime juice over both sides of the chicken (You can also add black pepper and chili powder to your taste if you like the chicken spicy). Place them in the air-fryer basket. Cook for 3 - 5 mins, 400F until the skin is brown.

Put all ingredients into a pot, pour in coconut milk and cook uncovered about 10 minutes.

To give some more proteins to the dish, Sri Lankans serve it with hard boiled eggs too, which they boil directly in the coconut curry.

String hoppers with coconut curry can feel a bit mild compared to other Sri Lankan dishes. Thats probably why we got it for lunch with picant onion sambal, which was a great combination by the way.

1 and 1/2 tbs butter
1/2 tsp salt
2/3 cup water

Other ingredients:

chicken curry leftovers including sauce
handful white cabbage cut into strips

3 clovesÂ garlicÂ crushed
1-2 cm long piece of freshÂ ginger

Â (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});","Process

DOUGH:

Mix dough ingredients and process properly. Create balls, golf ball size, put one next to each other, coat with oil and let them rest.

Then take a ball of the dough and create large and a very thin griddlecakes. It is important to work on a smooth metal board, that the dough doesnt stick to it. When you have a large and tiny griddlecake, put on a hotplate coated slightly with oil. Then create another one, put on top of the first one and turn both of them, then continue like this again and again, that you always have the newly added directly on the hotplate.

Then take all of the griddlecakes, create roll of them and start cutting it from the side. Then turn the heap by 90 degrees and continue cutting. And as what you want are just a tiny pieces of dough, if you can see some larger parts, chop them fine.

Â 

MIXING WITH OTHER INGREDIENTS

Fry curry leaves, garlic and ginger on a bit of oil. Add carrot, white cabbage, leak, red onions, green chilies. Then add an egg, leftovers of chicken curry, chili flakes, chicken curry sauce. Mix and chop. Please see the video.

There are so many variants of kottu. You can use just an egg and chicken curry, or vegetarian version, meaning egg and vegetable only. It simply depends on your preferences and fantasy.

This process is for the tiny lentils. If you use the bigger ones, the process is the same, but for cooking use water only (no coconut milk or cream). Length of cooking depends on the size of lentils. Add coconut cream just 5 minutes before the end of cooking.

Half a coconut. If you do not know how to open it, watch the video below. If you do not dare to try the pictured way, just hit some hard sharp edge with some power. For instance I do it in front of the house on the concrete edge of the pavement ;). Pour out the juice. If it is completely pure, you can drink it. White coconut meat grate very fine. If you have a special coconut grater, use it, if not, take off the white meat and grate on hand grater or in electrical blender as fine as possible.Â 

Squeeze and strain it. The first batch is coconut cream. Then mix coconut with a bit of water, process properly and squeeze and strain again. You can put it into the blender again. Repeat once more. The liquid from these two rounds is coconut milk.

To give you an approximate idea how much water to use, for coconut milk the ratio of coconut meat and water is 1:1, for coconut cream it is 4:1 (or no water at all).Â 

Coconut milk and cream is essential for most kinds of Sri Lanka curries. The curry recipes you will find among others from Sri Lanka. In majority of recipes coconut milk is put to the dish at the beginning of cooking process and coconut cream few minutes before the end.

118,Egg and plain hoppers - Bithara Aappe,"Ingredientsbatter for about 20 pcs (= plain hopper):

1 kg of rice flour
3 eggs (and extra egg for each egg hopper)
coconut milk from 1 fresh coconut (750 ml) or 1 large can of coconut milk mixed with water to reach 3/4 l amount
1 tsp yeast
4 tsp salt
5 tsp sugar
bit of vegetable oil for the pan (e.g. coconut oil)
pepper (for egg hopper)

Dip:

chili sauce

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});","
Process

We make home made coconut milk from a fresh coconut and 3/4 l of water (process here) or use milk in can mixed with water to reach 3/4 l content. We mix about half of it with the rice flour and yeast and let rest for at least 30 mins. Then add the rest of the milk, salt and sugar, mix again, until we reach still runny but thick batter as well.

We coat small deep pan by a very tiny bit of oil, put on big fire. Then reduce the heat, pour a middle size soup laddle of the batter to the pan and spread around the walls as well and cover the pan. It is ready in about 1,5 min, when it starts to be brownish. So this is the plain hopper, which we serve with chilli sauce or leftovers from fish or meat curry.

To get an egg hopper, we put an egg in the middle of the pan just straight after spreading the batter. Break yolk and by making circles with the pan spread to the sides and cover. Then shake it again, add pepper and cover again. Entire process lasts less than 2 mins. Egg hoppers are served as they are or the same way like the plain ones.

For better understanding of the process we recommend to watch the video ;) .

Mix the yeast with 100ml coconut milk, sugar and whisk. Leave for 30 minutes until the batter starts to foam. Add the remaining coconut milk and 100ml warm water.

STEP 2

Tip the flour into a large bowl, make a well in the centre and pour in the yeasty coconut liquid. Whisk until smooth, it should be quite a thin batter. Cover with clingfilm and leave at room temperature overnight.

STEP 3

For the coconut sambol, put the green chilli, chilli powder, shallots and fish flakes with 1 tsp salt in a blender. Whizz until smooth. Tip into a bowl and mix with the grated coconut, a good grinding of black pepper, and the lime juice. Cover and chill.

STEP 4

Put a hopper pan, or a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Season the batter with pinch of salt and add a little water to loosen the batter if itâ€™s too thick. It should be like single cream. Add 1 tsp coconut oil to the pan and tip the pan to coat it in the oil.

STEP 5

Add a ladleful of batter to the pan, and swirl to make a thin pancake that comes up the sides. Keep swirling the pan to get a few coatings of the pancake up the sides.

STEP 6

When the sides start to set, crack an egg into the middle of the pancake and cover with a lid or a baking tray. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the egg white has set.

STEP 7

Using a spatula, ease the pancake from the pan, and lift out. Repeat with another tsp oil, with the remaining batter and eggs. Serve with the sambol and chilli sauce.

Take care to mix it all in one direction, to make the mixture sticky.When mixed properly, the ground meat will become sticky (almost like dumpling filling). This will ensure you have nicely formed meatballs that will be juicy and not crumble when cooked.To form the meat into meatballs, have a bowl of cold tap water close by so you can wet your hands and utensils which will prevent the meat from sticking to them.Use a cookie scoop or spoon to portion the meat mixture. I use a 2 tbsp cookie scoop. Take each portion and gently form it into a smooth ball by rolling it in your hands. Make sure your hands are wet, so that the meat doesn't stick. You should be able to get about 30 meatballs. Let the meatballs sit for at least 30 minutes to marinate. This is optional, but I like to marinate them if I have time. You can also let them marinate BEFORE rolling them into balls.

Ingredients:â–¢ 500 g all purpose flour about 4 cups of flour, measured by spoon and level methodâ–¢ 1 tsp sea saltâ–¢ 180 mL boiling water Â¾ cupâ–¢ 180 mL room temperature water Â¾ cupâ–¢ Oil for coating, layering, and cookingâ–¢ Butter or ghee optional","Instructions:About 10 hours before you want to cook the roti (or at least 3 hours)In a large bowl, place the flour and salt. Stir to combine.500 g all purpose flour, 1 tsp sea saltWhile stirring the flour with a fork or spatula, add the hot water to form clumps in the flour. Stir until the water is dispersed throughout the dough (forming smaller clumps).180 mL boiling waterAdd the room temperature water while mixing (preferably with your hands), until you form a scraggly dough. The dough should be fairly soft, but not sticky.180 mL room temperature waterOnce you form a rough dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This helps to develop gluten, so you can also leave covered upto 1 hour for more gluten development. After 30 minutes, the dough should have absorbed all of the water well, and softened a little bit. Knead this dough for about 2 â€“ 3 minutes to form a dough with a smooth, satiny surface. Knead longer if needed until the dough has a smooth surface. Weigh the dough, and divide it into 8 equal portions (about 90 â€“ 100 g per portion). Shape each dough portion into a smooth dough ball. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.Keep a small bowl and a large plate (or flat container) ready. Place some vegetable oil in the bowl. Spread some oil on the bottom of the large plate / flat container as well.OilRoll the dough balls in the oil to coat. Place each coated dough ball on the plate. Make sure there is at least Â½ inch space between the dough balls if possible (otherwise they will stick to each other).Cover with plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for at least 2 hours, or up to 12 hours. I prefer to let the dough rest for at least 2 hours (they are more pliable this way) if I'm in a  hurry, OR overnight whenever possible.

  
      
        
        
        
      
    

Shaping the roti canaiPlace some oil (or butter and ghee) in a bowl.Oil, Butter or gheeTake one dough ball and flatten it out on a smooth work surface. Use your hands to stretch out the dough until they are paper thin, and you can see through the dough.TIP â€“ To stretch the dough, flatten the dough with your palm to get a circle / square shape. Press one end of the dough onto your work surface, so that it lightly sticks to the surface. Then gently stretch the opposite end of the dough. Repeat all around, so that you stretch out the dough evenly. It can be a circle or rectangle in shape. Try your best not to tear the roti. This takes practice, but with more experience, you will get fewer and fewer tears. Spread some oil (or butter or ghee) on the surface of the roti. Donâ€™t make this layer of fat too thick.Roll up the dough into a tube. Make sure you roll up the dough firmly into a log. Alternatively, you can gather the dough from either end in 0.5 â€“ 1 inch folds that are on top of each other (see the panel of images in the post â€“ ""the roti after folding"").Once you have rolled up / folded the dough, coil the dough into a spiral (see pictures in the post). Make sure the spiral is tightly coiled. Also make sure to tuck the ends of the dough under the spiral, and then press down the spiral with your palm. This should hopefully help seal the spiral/coil.Place this on the plate again (with some oil at the bottom). Repeat with the rest of the dough portions.Cover the dough with plastic wrap, and let it rest for at least another hour.Cooking the roti canaiPlease note that the heat recommended for cooking the roti can vary from stove to stove. So adjust the heat accordingly.Use at least an 8 inch non-stick pan (or tawa). Heat over medium heat.Once the pan is heated, place one portion of the coiled roti on your work surface and flatten it out into a 6 â€“ 7 inch roti using your hands. You can use a rolling pin as well, but I personally prefer to use my hands.Add a few drops of oil into the pan, or brush the surface of the pan with some oil. Place the roti in the pan and cook until golden brown. Flip the roti and cook until the other side is also golden brown and cooked through. The total cook time (for me) is about 4 minutes per roti. I flip the roti throughout the cooking process to ensure even browning on both sides.Place the cooked roti on a cooling rack. While itâ€™s still hot, use your hands to squash the roti (kind of in a clapping motion). This helps separate the layers in the cooked roti.Repeat with all of the dough portions.Serve while warm, with curry, or however you like!",[' all about'],"

Coffee buttercreamPlace the butter in the bowl of your stand mixer. With a whisk attachment, whip the butter until creamy and white in color â€“ about 3 to 7 minutes on high speed (not maximum speed). Take as long as you need to make the butter very creamy.455 g unsalted butterDissolve the instant coffee in 1 â€“ 2 tbsp of water and stir it into the cream.4 â€“ 6 tsp instant coffee granules, 80 mL cold whipping creamAdd the salt, coffee cream, and vanilla into the butter, and whisk further until the butter-cream mix is light and fluffy (for a few minutes).Â½ tsp salt, 80 mL cold whipping cream, 4 â€“ 6 tsp instant coffee granules, 1 tbsp vanilla extractLower the speed and add 500 g (4 cups) of the confectionerâ€™s sugar â€“ a little at a time, and incorporate the confectioner's sugar into the butter. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as you go.500 â€“ 567 g confectionerâ€™s sugarOnce the sugar is incorporated into the butter, increase the speed, and whisk on high for 1 â€“ 3 minutes. Taste and add the rest of the confectionerâ€™s sugar if you want a sweeter buttercream. Whisk for a further 2 â€“ 3 minutes until you have a light, fluffy, soft, spreadable frosting.500 â€“ 567 g confectionerâ€™s sugarIf the frosting is too stiff, you can add extra cream (1 tbsp at a time) to get an even softer buttercream. If you want the buttercream to have a stronger coffee flavor, you can also dissolve any extra coffee granules into 1 tbsp of water and whisk in that as well.Assembling the cakeLevel the top of the cake layers (if they are domed).Place one cake layer on a cake serving plate or decorating plate. Make sure the bottom of the cake is facing down.Place about Â¾ cup of the frosting on top of this cake layer and spread it evenly. You can add more or less of the frosting as you like.Now place the second cake layer on top. Make sure the bottom of the cake is facing up this time, so that you have a level surface on top to frost. Gently press the cake down to make sure the cake layer sticks to the buttercream below.Apply a thin coating of the frosting to completely cover the cake. This is the crumb coating. The crumb coating will help make the sides and top of the cake even, and make it easier to frost the final layer of buttercream.Allow the crumb coating to set in the fridge (or a cool place in your kitchen) for a few minutes.Evenly spread the rest of the frosting over the cake. Use an offset spatula to create swirls for an old fashioned cake look, OR use a bench scraper or spatula to smooth out the frosting.DecorationDecorate the cake however you like. Here, I applied one strip of soft chocolate fudge sauce inside a pastry bag, and then filled the pastry bag with the coffee buttercream. This creates a chocolate marble effect in the buttercream when piped (as you can see in the pictures).Chocolate fudge sauceAlternatively, you can pipe a plain buttercream border, or use the sprinkles or crushed cookies to decorate the cake.Chocolate covered coffee beans, Chocolate sprinkles, Speculoos cookies

Some caramelization on the meat pieces is ideal, but not necessary.Add the water and let it come to a boil. Add the coconut milk at this point, if you'd like the coconut milk to split in the curry. This enhances the flavor of the curry. Otherwise, leave out the coconut milk until towards the end of the cook time. This will yield a creamy curry sauce.Â½ cup water, Â½ cup coconut milkLower the heat to a simmer. Let the curry simmer (uncovered), for about 30 minutes.

You can also place the lid on the pot half way through the cooking time.When the beef is very tender (about 30 â€“ 40 minutes of simmering), the curry is ready. Taste and season to  your preference. Salt to tasteIf you didnâ€™t add the coconut milk at the beginning, then add it towards the end of the cook time. Stir the coconut milk through the curry, and allow the curry to come back to a simmer.The curry is now ready. Let the curry preferably rest for about 30 minutes to let the flavors â€œmingleâ€.

Make sure each egg addition is mixed in well before adding the next one. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl in between additions so that the eggs are mixed in well. 250 g eggsOnce the eggs are mixed through, the batter is ready for the dry ingredients.Sift the flour and baking powder together. Place the room temperature milk in a small jug/container.250 g all purpose flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 79 mL milkAdd the sifted dry ingredients in 3 - 4 additions, alternating with the milk, and ending with the dry ingredients. (Once you add the first portion of dry ingredients, FOLD it in with a spatula. Then add half of the milk and fold that into the mixture as well. Repeat with another portion of dry ingredients and the rest of the milk, then end with the final portion of dry ingredients.)Make sure there are no flour lumps in the mixture at this point, but also be careful not to overmix the flour in the batter.Scrape the batter into the prepared baking pan. Using an offset spatula, spread the batter evenly in the pan. Knock the pan against your kitchen counter 2 - 3 times to remove any trapped air bubbles and to evenly spread the batter in the pan.Place the baking pan in the preheated oven, and bake for 35 - 40 minutes, until the cake is baked through. Rotate the pan once (carefully) halfway through the baking time. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, and the surface of the cake is slightly springy to the touch.Remove the pan from the oven and let it cool down for 5 - 10 minutes. Carefully flip the cake out onto a cooling wire rack. Peel off the parchment paper, and then flip the cake over again (so that it's right side up). Use a cake lifter or a cutting board to help with this, because the cake is soft at this point and could break.Let the cake cool completely. Store the cake in an air-tight container for up to 3 days, or in the fridge for up to 5 days. This cake (wrapped and stored in a container) will freeze very well, and can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.Slice the cake into any size pieces. I have sliced them into 1â€ x 2â€ sized pieces in these photos (28 - 32 pieces). Serve immediately.

Mix to combine well.400 g AP flour, 150 g shredded desiccated coconut, 1 Â¼ tsp sea salt, 1 medium red onion, 3 long, green chiliMix the water and coconut milk in another bowl or jug.120 mL coconut milk, 120 mL waterAdd the liquid to the flour mixture, a little at a time, while stirring the flour with your fingertips (or with a fork). After adding about Â½ of the liquid, gently stir the mixture. You will have some clumps and dry spots of flour. Drizzle the liquid over the dry parts of the flour, while mixing, to form a dough.Add 1 or 2 more tbsp of water ONLY if needed. The dough should come together, but still have dry spots on the surface. This is OK.If you add too much water, sprinkle in a little extra flour and lightly knead it into the dough (donâ€™t over-knead!). Shape the dough into a rough ball.Cover the dough (or the bowl) with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for at least 4 hours, or up to 12 hours (room temperature is fine). If you want to store the dough for up to 24 hours, then refrigerate it.The dough should become really soft after it has rested. If itâ€™s very sticky, generously flour the dough and the work surface to prevent it from sticking to your counter.Transfer the dough to your floured work surface. Cut the dough into 8 wedges. Lightly roll up each section into a rough ball. See pictures in the post.Take each dough ball and sprinkle some flour on top and on the work surface. Flatten it to a disc, and then roll it out to a circle using a rolling pin. The roti should be about 0.4 - 0.5 cm thick, and about 12 -15 cm (5 - 6 inches) in diameter. Cover the rolled out roti with a cloth napkin or plastic wrap (so that it doesn't dry out), and repeat rolling out all of the dough portions.Preheat a cast iron skillet or non-stick skillet over medium or medium high heat.When the pan is heated, transfer a roti onto the skillet and cook for about 2 - 3 minutes, until the bottom starts to develop brown spots.Flip the roti over and cook the other side for 2 - 3 minutes, until you get brown spots on that side too.Place the cooked roti on a wire rack to cool down. Repeat with the rest of the roti.Eat the roti warm or at room temperature.

Vegetarian curry puffsRoll out the puff pastry to a thickness of about 3 mm. If using puff pastry sheets, you may still need to roll it out until it has the desired thickness.Using a 3.5 inch cookie cutter, cut out circles of puff pastry. Alternatively you can cut the puff pastry into 3.5 - 4 inch squares as well.Flatten the edge of the puff pastry circle and place it on your palm. Then while your palm is slightly cupped, fill the center with a generous spoonful of the curried potato and pea filling.Moisten the edge of the puff pastry and fold it over to form a puff  pastry half circle. Seal the edge well with your fingers first, and then crimp the edges with a fork. (See pictures in the post for more details.)If using square pastries, fold over to form a triangle, seal the edges with your fingers first, and then crimp with a fork, as above.Place the pastries on a parchment paper-lined baking tray and cover with plastic wrap or a clean cloth napkin. Repeat with all of the pastry and filling.Keep the pastries at room temperature if youâ€™re baking them immediately. If youâ€™re baking the next day, keep them covered with plastic wrap in the fridge (take care not to let the pastries touch, as they will stick to each other).If you want to store them for longer, then transfer them to the freezer.Baking the curry puffsPreheat oven to 375Â°F.Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Bread DoughPlace the first 7 ingredients in the mixer bowl of your stand mixer. Use a dough hook or wooden spoon to mix the ingredients until combined. You can use the paddle attachment in your mixer to do this as well.With a kneading hook, knead the dough for about 5 minutes. The dough should be soft and slightly tacky (not sticky). If the dough is too dry, you can add the extra water, 1 tbsp at a time, while kneading the dough.Add the 2 tbsp butter or oil and knead for a further 5 â€“ 10 minutes, until you have a smooth, soft, tacky dough.Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the fridge to let it rise overnight.The next day, remove the chilled dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured work surface. Flatten the dough gently with your hand to remove some of the air in the dough.Divide the dough into 12 portions. You can divide the dough by weighing it â€“ about 70 to 73 g per portion. OR you can roll the dough into a log with even thickness, and cut it into 12 equal sections.Gently knead each portion to form a smooth ball (about 45 sec â€“ 1 min, donâ€™t over-knead the dough).To make the Beef BunsLine 1 half sheet pan, and 1 quarter sheet pan with parchment paper.Flatten each dough ball into a circle using your hands. With your fingers, pinch the edges to create a thinner edge than in the center.Place the dough circle in the cupped palm of your hand. Take 2 heaping teaspoons (regular teaspoon, NOT measuring teaspoons) of the spicy beef filling and press it gently into the middle of the dough (the dough will stretch out slightly as you do this).Stretch the edges of the dough over the filling, and pinch the edges together to seal in the filling. When this is done, gently roll the bread roll in your hands to make it smooth and to properly seal the roll (see pictures in the post).Place the buns on the sheet pans with the sealed side down. Space them out well. You can fit 9 on the half sheet pan, and 3 on the quarter sheet pan.Cover the sheet pan with plastic wrap and allow the buns to proof for 30 â€“ 45 minutes, until they double (or 1.5x) in size.Preheat oven to 350Â°F (180Â°C) while the buns are rising.When the beef buns are ready to be baked, whisk the egg in a small bowl for the egg wash. Remove the plastic wrap gently and brush the tops of the buns with a light coating of the egg wash.Bake in preheated oven for 20 â€“ 30 minutes, until the buns are a beautiful golden brown in color.Â Remove from the oven and allow the buns to cool down slightly.

Butter and line a 9 x 13 inch pan with parchment paper. (If you prefer making a round cake, you can butter and line 2 x 8 inch pans OR 2 x 9 inch pans).Make the cake batter according to this recipe.Divide the cake batter into 3 bowls. This is roughly about 400 g (14.1 oz) of batter per portion.Add a drop or two of food coloring into each portion (yellow, pink and green). Mix the batter to create the pastel colored cake batters.Dollop the batter into the prepared cake pan, while alternating colors. If you are using round cake pans, remember to divide the cake batter evenly between the pans â€“ about 608 g (21.4 oz) batter per pan.Swirl the colors in the pan, and make the surface smooth. Knock the pan on the counter/work surface 2 â€“ 3 times to remove any air, and to even out the cake batter in the pan.Bake the 9 x 13 inch pan in the preheated oven for 30 â€“ 35 minutes (mine takes about 32 minutes). (See Recipe Notes for bake times for 8 inch or 9 inch pans).Once the cake is baked, remove from the oven and let it cool down slightly. Turn the cake out onto a cooling rack, and let it cool down completely. The cake is now ready to be iced.

  
      
        
        
        
      
    

Buttercream FrostingMake the vanilla buttercream frosting according to the recipe instructions here.Â For the Classic Ribbon CakeEvenly spread a layer of vanilla buttercream on top of the cake. Trim the edges to get clean straight lines.Pipe a simple border with a small closed star tip. Sprinkle funfetti (optional) on the surface of the cake. The middle of the cake can be used to pipe a message OR can be kept clean.For the Pastel Easter CakeDivide the buttercream frosting into 3 portions. One portion should be less than the other two. Color the smaller portion with green food coloring. Color the other two with pink and yellow.Apple a crumb coating to the top of the cake. Trim the edges of the cake, and crumb coat the sides as well.Put each of the buttercream frosting into piping bags and cut openings. Use another piping bag to attach the piping tips (so that itâ€™ll be easier to change between the colors for each tip).With a round tip, pipe two thin lines of the pink and yellow frostings along the side of the cake. Using an offset  spatula smoothen the sides to create an ombre look.Pipe some of the frosting on the top of the cake as well, creating random patterns. Using an offset spatula, spread the buttercream to create a swirled pattern, and to make it smooth.Pipe a border along the cake with the rest of the pink and yellow buttercream.Using the green buttercream frosting and tip #234, create grass patches on the surface of the cake. Using tip #18, create drop flowers with pink and yellow buttercream (optional). Decorate with Easter eggs and Easter bunny chocolates.Place the cake on a cake serving platter and surround it with edible grass and more Easter eggs (optional).",['Ribbon Cake  recipe vanilla cake batter Pink food coloring Yellow food coloring Green food coloringVanilla Buttercream recipe perfect vanilla buttercream Pink food coloring Yellow food coloring Easter cake Green food coloring Easter cakeDecorating Sprinkles Easter eggs Easter cake Easter Easter cake Easter bunnies Easter cake Edible grass Easter cake Wilton tip Wilton tip'],"

Each piece should be fairly small but not bite-sized. A regular chicken thigh should be cut in half and larger pieces should be cut into 3. A chicken breast should be cut into 3 pieces or more. The larger the chicken piece, the longer it will take to cook through, so it's important to keep the pieces fairly similar in size. Add the coconut oil into a large saucepan and heat the oil over medium heat. Add onions and cook until they start to soften.2 â€“ 3 tbsp coconut oil, Â½ yellow onionAdd the garlic and ginger to the softened onions, and sautÃ© until the garlic starts to soften.

Cook for 10 minutes with the lid off, on medium high heat. Frequently stir to make sure the chicken or the spices donâ€™t burn.Â½ tsp salt, 2 lbs chicken, 2 serrano peppers (or regular green chili), 3 small roma tomatoes, 2 tsp brown sugarAdd coconut milk, water, lime juice / vinegar, and bring the curry to a boil. If you want less gravy, add less liquid.Â½ cup full-fat coconut milk, Â½ cup water, 2 tsp lime juice or apple cider vinegarLower the heat and let it simmer with the lid on for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Leave the lid off if you want to reduce the liquid content in the curry. The chicken should be completely cooked by this point. This will depend on the size of the chicken pieces and the stove you use. Taste the curry and season with more salt to taste if needed. You can add the rest of the sugar or more salt, or vinegar to your taste. Remember that curries can easily be adjusted to your taste! If the chicken curry gravy is too thin, or there's too much of it, uncover and simmer the curry for a further 10 minutes or longer. This step is optional, but it allows the water to evaporate and for the gravy to thicken. If you want more gravy, you can add more water or coconut milk, but you will need to adjust the flavor accordingly. Turn off the heat and let the chicken cool down slightly. Serve with rice or roti. For best results, store the chicken curry in the fridge overnight and eat it the next day. (Seriously, it tastes even better the next day!)

Whisk to combine.Make a well in the middle of the flour mix. Add the water-yolk mix and use a fork or your fingers to distribute the liquid through the flour. When the liquid has been distributed, you will have to use your hands to knead the dough to form a dough ball.If the dough is too dry, add iced water 1 tbsp at a time (or less), up to 2 tbsp. The dough should come together to make a pliable dough thatâ€™s not sticky. If it still seems too dry, dip only your fingers in the ice water and without shaking off any excess water, knead the dough with your wet hands.Form a disc with the pastry dough, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour. If you make the dough the day before and the dough is too chilled, let the dough soften slightly at room temperature.

  
      
        
        
        
      
    

Curried Fish FillingMake sure the canned fish has been drained and the bones removed. If youâ€™re using cooked fresh fish, make sure the fish has been de-boned as well.Heat 2 tbsp of vegetable oil or coconut oil in a large non-stick pan over medium high heat.Add the finely chopped onion and saute for a few minutes until they have softened. Add the garlic, ginger and saute for a further 30 seconds until softened.Add the curry powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper. Mix through the onions.Add the fish and mix it with the onion-spice mix. Break the fish into smaller pieces and saute the mix until itâ€™s dry, and takes on the color of the spices, about 10 â€“ 15 minutes. Do not allow the mix to burn (reduce the heat if necessary). Add the tomato ketchup and green chili peppers (serrano peppers) and mix through and cook for a further 5 â€“ 10 minutes.Season with salt if needed (remember you are using brined mackerel, and may not need a lot of salt).Mash the potatoes slightly (with some small whole pieces left intact), and add this to the fish mix. Mix well. Sprinkle the lime juice over the fish and potatoes and mix well. Season and add more lime juice and salt if necessary.Let the mix cool down.AssemblyRoll out the cool patties dough on a lightly floured smooth surface. Roll out until the dough is about 3 mm thick. To ensure the dough doesnâ€™t stick to the surface, lightly dust the surface and flip the dough over half way through rolling. This will help prevent shrinking of the dough and itâ€™ll roll out better too. Make sure the rolled out dough isnâ€™t sticking to the surface before cutting the patties dough wrappers as well.Cut 3 â€“ 3.5 inch diameter circles using a pastry cutter. Set these aside in one layer and cover with plastic wrap. Re-roll the scraps and cut more pastry circles. You should get approximately 15 â€“ 17 wrappers.Take one dough wrapper, and with your fingers, flatten it out slightly at the edges to create a slightly bigger circle (especially if the wrappers shrink a little).Take a spoonful of the fish filling and form a ball thatâ€™s about  1 Â½ inches in diameter. Place this in the middle of the wrapper.Apply water along the edge of one half of the wrapper. Carefully fold over the other half of the wrapper over the filling toward the moistened edge and press down to seal. Use your fingers to form a seal along the edge, and then use a fork to crimp the edges.Transfer the patties to a plate and cover with a plastic wrap. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers.To FryHeat enough oil to deep fry the fish patties (about 3 â€“ 4 inches), or to shallow fry (about 1 Â½ â€“ 2 inches).Once the oil is heated to 350Â°F / 180Â°C, fry the patties in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.The patties should fry for about 2  minutes until they turn golden brown in the center and slightly darker at the edges (about 1 minute per side if shallow frying). If you are frying the patties from frozen, they need to deep fry for about 3 â€“ 4 minutes until they turn golden brown in the center and slightly darker at the edges.Place the fried patties on paper towels to drain the excess oil.Serve while warm or at room temperature with tomato ketchup or chili sauce.

Make sure you scrape down the sides periodically.1 tbsp vanilla extractWhile the buttercream is being mixed, add half of the cream in a drizzle and whisk for 1 minute until the buttercream is light, fluffy and well mixed. Add more if you want the buttercream to be softer. Cover and set aside until you are ready to use. If the buttercream sets, whisk it to make it fluffy again before frosting the cake.Â½ cup heavy creamCaramel Nest (this is an optional step)Use an open whisk, or cut off the rounded wire tips of an old whisk to form an open whisk (see picture in the post).Place the sugar, corn syrup and water in a saucepan. Heat gently until the sugar is completely melted â€“ swirl the saucepan to help the sugar melt evenly.150 g white sugar, 3 tbsp corn syrup, 3 tbsp waterCover the pot and let the sugar syrup simmer for 1 â€“ 2 minutes (the condensation will help wash down the sugar crystals from the sides of the pot).Uncover and let the sugar syrup boil, until the sugar turns into a golden amber color. You can gently swirl the pot so that the sugar caramelizes evenly. While the sugar is cooking, line your table top with a large piece of parchment paper, or turn a bowl (about 7 inches in diameter) upside down and lightly oil the outside of the bowl. This is a messy job, so you can lay newspapers in the area around your workspace to make clean up easy. When the sugar is ready, use a whisk to dip into the caramel and then gently fling caramel threads on to the bowl / parchment paper. Shape the caramel into a bowl-like (nest-like) shape, and let the caramel set.Store in an airtight container (with some desiccant to make sure it lasts longer).Assembling & Decorating The CakePlace one cake layer (flat side down) on a cake tray. Add Â½ â€“ Â¾ cup of the buttercream frosting on top and spread it evenly. Repeat with all the cake layers, with the last layer placed with the flat side up.Apply a thin coating of vanilla frosting on the sides and on top to form a cake crumb layer, and to fill in the sides of the cake layers. Refrigerate for a few minutes until the coating has set.Once set, generously spread frosting on the sides and on top (this will be the frosting layer). Use a cake scraper or spatula to smoothen the sides and the top so that you have clean straight surfaces. Refrigerate to set.Add about Â½ cup each of buttercream into two bowls and color them with pink and yellow.Pink and yellow gel coloringWhen the cake has set again, dot the surface of the cake with pink, yellow and white frosting, and smoothen the sides again to form a watercolor frosting effect with the pastel colors.Refrigerate until youâ€™re ready to serve the cake.Transfer the cake to a cake serving platter, and pipe a border along the bottom of the cake.The cake can be served as is, or decorated with chocolate on top.Place Easter eggs along the top border of the cake.

Let the crepe batter sit at room temperature, covered, for about 15 â€“ 30 minutes to rest.WITHOUT A BLENDER â€“ place all the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk all the wet ingredients together in a jug.Create a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and slowly pour the wet ingredient mix, while whisking. After adding half of the liquid, whisk the mix to ensure there are no lumps. Add the rest of the liquid and whisk until smooth. Let it rest, covered, for 15 â€“ 30 minutes until you are ready to use it.MAKING THE CREPES â€“ heat a 6 inch or 8 inch non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Brush some oil on the surface of the pan when itâ€™s hot.Pour Â¼ cup of the batter into the hot pan, while swirling, to evenly coat the surface of the pan. The batter will create bubbles on the surface if it's hot enough (this is characteristic of Sri Lankan crepes, but it's optional). Cover any big holes with some loose batter.Cook for about 30 seconds, until the edges turn golden brown in color.Loosen the crepe and flip it over, and cook for a further 15 â€“ 30 seconds.Both sides should be golden to dark golden brown in color.Flip the crepes over on to a plate and stack them on top of each other until you have cooked all the crepes.Once all the crepes are cooked, cover the stack with a clean cloth and let it cool.A NOTE ABOUT THE CREPES â€“ if the pan is not as hot, the crepes will take a little longer to cook, and the surface will be smooth (no bubbles), but still go ahead and flip the crepe when the edges start to brown. These will then look more like French crepes. The number of crepes you make will depend on the size of the pan as well.AssemblySpread about 2 tbsp of the coconut filling in the center of each cooled crepe. Fold one end over the filling. Fold the edges in and roll up the crepe roll to form a log/roll â€“ similar to how spring rolls are rolled up.Place the crepes on a plate, with the seam side down. Repeat with all the crepes.Cover the crepes with a cloth or plastic wrap until needed.Eat them plain, or with a cup of tea. Enjoy!

â–¢
3 â€“ 4 tbsp blood orange juice 1 blood orange
â–¢
1 tsp vanilla","Instructions:
Bread Dough
Place the first measurement of warm water in the mixer bowl and stir in the sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over this and leave it aside for about 10 minutes to activate the yeast (it should start to froth, if it doesnâ€™t the yeast may not be active).
Add the AP flour, salt, water and milk and start mixing the dough till it starts to come together.
Next, with a kneading hook, start mixing the dough till it comes together to form a ball. Add an extra tablespoon of water if it looks too dry.
Continue to knead the dough till it comes together and the water is absorbed completely.
Add the butter while kneading and incorporate it completely into the dough. If the dough is sticking to the sides (because of the butter) and not kneading properly, lightly dust the sides of the bowl with the smallest amount of flour â€“ this should bring the dough together.
Knead for about 8 minutes until the dough is soft and shiny.
Place the dough in an oiled bowl. If youâ€™re using it on the same day, cover and let it rise for about 1 hour. OR leave it in the fridge overnight (covered).
The dough is ready for the next step â€“ if you kept the dough in the fridge, let it come to room temperature. Cut the dough into pieces and set them aside.
Generously butter a 10 cup capacity bundt cake pan. Set aside.
Breudher Cake
Place the raisin and brandy in a saucepan. Heat gently until the alcohol is warm. Let the raisins soak in the brandy while the dough is proofing (or overnight).
When youâ€™re ready to make the Breudher Cake â€“ cream the butter and sugar in a stand mixer until light and fluffy. Add the brandy, vanilla, and orange zest and beat it for a few minutes until everything has mixed in.
Add the dough, one piece at a time while mixing the butter and sugar on medium speed (use the paddle beater). Once all the dough has been incorporated, start adding the eggs.
Add the eggs and yolk one at a time, while mixing in between each addition to make sure the eggs incorporate well.
Add the raisins and mix it all for a minute or two until the raisins are distributed throughout the dough.
Scrape the dough into the buttered bundt pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let it proof in a warm place for about 30 minutes or up to an hour. It wonâ€™t rise too much (definitely will not double in size), but the surface will inflate and look smooth.
Preheat oven to 325Â°F / 160Â°C while the bread is proofing.
Bake in preheated oven for about 50 min â€“ 1 hour, until a knife inserted into the cake comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly. Turn it out onto a wire rack and let it cool down completely.
Blood Orange Glaze (optional)
When the cake is ready to be iced â€“ sift the icing sugar into a bowl. Add 2 tbsp of blood orange juice and vanilla and whisk till it forms a thick icing. Add the remaining blood orange juice a little at a time, and mix well until you get the consistency you prefer. Pour over the cake and decorate with piped flowers (optional).

Filling the potstickersSee my post on perfect dumpling dough and potsticker dough for beginners for instructions with pictures on how to fill and seal potstickers/dumplings.. Once filled and sealed, these uncooked potstickers can be placed on a baking tray (one layer) and frozen. Once frozen, they can be transferred to freezer bags and stored in the freezer for later use.If using immediately â€“ heat some oil (peanut oil is best, though vegetable oil works just as well too) in a non-stick pan on medium-high heat.When well heated, place potstickers on the pan, without overcrowding it (I can fit about 8 on my pan). Heat for about 2 â€“ 3 minutes, until the bottom is lightly browned.While the pan is hot, add about Â¼ cup of water into the pan (the water should sizzle) and immediately cover with a lid. Steam for about 4 minutes.Remove the lid (most of the water should have evaporated, if not all), then let the bottom of the potstickers cook for another 1 â€“ 2 minutes, and turn golden brown (darker if you use green potsticker wrappers).Serve immediately.",['Pot ers green pot wrappers store bought homemade regular pot wrappers  lump crab meat claw meat fine too  will have deeper crab taste onion  minced ginger minced garlic heaped chilli akes less you prefer less spicy cabbage  cornstarch Ketjap Manis  tomato ketchup lemon juice spring onion  cilantro salt  oil'],"

181,Vegan Cardamom Spiced Coconut Ice Cream,"Ingredients:
Vegan Cardamom Spiced Coconut Ice Cream
â–¢
3 cups of thick coconut milk
â–¢
7.4 oz dark brown sugar with high molasses content like Muscovado sugar
â–¢
6-7 cardamom pods â€“ please see note
â–¢
Â¼ tsp grated nutmeg
â–¢
scant Â½ tsp Xanthan gum this can be found in most grocery or specialty stores â€“ sometimes in the gluten free section
â–¢
pinch of salt
Cardamom Cashew Praline
â–¢
Â½ tsp ground cardamom about 5 cardamom pod seeds ground, pre-ground is OK too
â–¢
4 oz / 115 g white sugar
â–¢
3 oz / 85 g roughly chopped cashew nuts roasted will taste better, but raw is OK too","Instructions:
Separate Â¼ cup of the dark brown sugar and set aside.
In a saucepan, combine the coconut milk, rest of the sugar, nutmeg, cardamom pods, salt and heat gently to completely dissolve the sugar and till the coconut milk has heated well.
Add the Xanthan gum to the sugar that you set aside earlier and mix very well.
Add this to the heated coconut milk and use an immersion hand blender to blend the Xanthan gum into the mixture properly â€“ for a few minutes. Alternatively, you can use a regular blender to do this as well (just make sure your blender can handle hot liquids â€“ if not, let the mixture cool down first and then proceed with this step).
The liquid should be thick but NOT GLOOPY. If it is gloopy, add a little water to thin it out to a thick consistency.
Let it cool completely and chill overnight in the fridge.
With ice cream machine
Churn the base according to the manufacturersâ€™ instructions and let it harden completely in a container for a few hours.
No churn method
Transfer the base into a shallow dish, and keep it in the freezer, covered.
Using a hand mixer, mix this mixture every hour incorporating air each time. Repeat every hour until the ice cream is completely frozen.
Serve as is or with Cardamom Cashew Praline.
Cardamom cashew praline
Prepare a silpat or parchment paper on a baking tray to pour the praline on.
To caramelize sugar using the dry method â€“ in a shallow nonstick pan, sprinkle the sugar in an even thin layer and heat the sugar on medium heat.
As the sugar starts to melt, move the sugar around to ensure it melts evenly which may result in some sugar clumps being formed. Keep heating the sugar while moving it around from time to time. DO NOT LEAVE THE SUGAR UNATTENDED.
The sugar will start to turn colour and melt completely. When the sugar turns a golden colour, sprinkle the cardamom over the caramel. When the sugar turns an amber colour, immediately remove from the heat and add the cashew, and using a spoon mix to coat the nuts as much as possible.
While still hot, pour this onto your silpat and flatten (using the spoon) as much as possible. BE CAREFUL NOT TO TOUCH THIS MIXTURE AS IT WILL BE VERY HOT!
Let it cool and harden completely.
Using the handle of a big knife or a pestle, break it into small pieces. Store in an air tight container until ready to use.

Bring the water to a boil and cook the potatoes until they are tender. Remove the potatoes from the water and remove the skin when they are cool to handle.Crush them with a fork (doesnâ€™t have to be smooth, little chunks are okay) and set aside.With a fork, flake or break the fish into small pieces. Just like the potatoes, some chunks are okay, since they will get crushed when they are being cooked.In a saucepan, heat the 3 tbsp of oil over medium heat.Add the onion, ginger and garlic and saute until the onions become tender and translucent.Add the green chilli peppers, salt, sugar and spices and saute for about a minute. Add the fish and cook while mixing the spices through the fish for about 10-15 minutes.Add the 2 tbsp lemon juice and tomato sauce and mix it through.Add the potatoes and mix it through the fish until well combined. Taste and add salt (to taste) and the remaining tablespoon of lemon juice if needed. Set the fish mix aside and let it cool.When it has cooled down, take a spoonful of the mix and roll it into a smooth 1 1/2 inch diameter ball. Leave these balls on a parchment paper lined baking tray.In a bowl, mix the two eggs and on a separate plate, mix the bread crumbs with the optional spices.Evenly coat each fish ball with the egg mix and then coat them with the bread crumbs. Make sure to evenly coat the fish balls with breadcrumbs. Take care to not cause any cracks. If there is a crack you can re-dip in the egg wash and re-coat with breadcrumbs.In a saucepan heat enough oil to deep fry the cutlets to about 350Â°F/180Â°C.When the oil is hot enough, fry the cutlets until they turn a dark golden brown â€“ about a minute. You can fry a few cutlets at a time in the oil without overcrowding the pan.Place the fried cutlets on a paper towel to drain the excess oil. You can keep the cutlets in a warm oven to keep them warm and crispy until you are ready to serve.Serve with tomato sauce or chilli sauce as a snack. Or as a side dish for a rice and curry meal.

â–¢

â–¢

â–¢

For the Tanzhong
In a saucepan combine half the milk and 3 tbsp of Flour and whisk until there are no clumps.
Heat gently on the stove until the mix thickens to a runny paste.
Set aside to cool.
For the Dough
Mix the rest of the milk, half of the sugar and yeast in a bowl and leave for about 15 minutes until bubbles (froth) start to appear.
In a mixing bowl, mix the flour, rest of the sugar, salt, egg, egg yolk and softened butter.
With the dough hook turned to low, add the tanzhong and the milk/yeast mix in to the flour and mix until the dough comes together. Add a few teaspoons of milk if the dough looks too dry, or some flour if the mix seems too wet.
Knead for 10-15 more minutes on low (remember to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl from time to time). The dough should stick to the dough hook and the bottom of the bowl when kneading. The dough should be very soft and smooth, and a little shiny when you are done kneading. It is a little sticky, and when touched by your hand just slightly sticks to your fingers but comes off cleanly.
Add the raisins in the last 5 minutes of kneading.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place to double in size for at least 1 hour.
Punch the risen dough down and turn it out on to a lightly floured surface.
Divide the dough into 8 portions and form balls and place them on a baking tray with parchment paper. Leave plenty of room between the dough to make sure they do not stick together.
Cover loosely and let it rise for about 45 minutes to an hour.
Preheat oven to 325Â°F/165Â°C. Bake in pre-heated oven for 15 minutes until buns are golden brown on top.

40 slices soft white sandwich bread see recipe notes","Instructions:
Spinach filling
To steam the vegetables, you will need a large pot with a capacity to hold a steamer basket with the lid on.
Pour about 1 â€“ 2 inches of water to the bottom of the pot and bring it to a simmer, with the lid on.
Add the baby spinach and let it steam for a few minutes until the spinach has just wilted and softened.
570 g baby spinach
Remove the steamer basket from the pot and place the steamed spinach in a bowl, and let it cool completely.
Once cooled, squeeze the spinach to remove as much water as possible. You can squeeze a little at a time in your hands OR place the spinach in a cheesecloth and squeeze the water out.
The remaining spinach should weigh about 220 â€“ 230 g.
If youâ€™re using lettuce, cut the lettuce into smaller pieces and steam it the same way as the spinach.
Let it cool and then squeeze out the water in the same manner.
Place the spinach and the spices in the ingredients list (except for the margarine) in a small food processor and process until you have a rough-looking paste. The weight of the paste will vary, but you want to have about 250 g of the green paste.
20 g parsley,2 green chili peppers,Â¼ tsp sea salt,Generous pinch of pepper
In a large bowl, place the margarine and 250 g of the green vegetable paste and whisk together until you have a smooth green buttery spread. Taste and season with salt to taste.
150 g margarine
Scrape this into a bowl and set aside until needed.
Carrot filling
The baby carrots can be steamed as they are, but if you're using larger carrots, you can cut them into smaller pieces.
350 g baby carrots
Steam the carrots in a steamer basket for 15 â€“ 20 minutes, OR until the carrots are fork-tender (the fork should go through very easily). Top up the pot with water as needed while steaming.
Remove the carrots from the basket and let them cool down on a paper towel or kitchen napkin. Do not cover the carrots, since you want as much of the water to evaporate as it cools down.
You should have about 250 g of steamed carrots.
Place the steamed and cooled carrots in a food processor, along with all the spices in the ingredients list (excluding the margarine).
Â¼ tsp turmeric,Generous pinch of black pepper,Â¼ tsp sea salt,Â½ tsp ground coriander or cumin,Â¼ tsp honey
Process until you have a rough-looking paste that still has small pieces of carrots in it (i.e. not a smooth, fine paste).
The weight of this paste should be around 260 g (at least 250 g).
In a large bowl, place the margarine and 250 g of the carrot paste and whisk together until you have a smooth orange and yellow buttery spread. Taste and season with salt to taste.
170 g margarine
Scrape this into a bowl and set aside until needed.
Beetroot filling
Slice off the tops of the beetroots and then steam them the same way as the carrots.
350 g beetroot
Remove the beetroots from the steamer basket and let them cool down on a paper towel or kitchen napkin until cooled to room temperature. PLEASE NOTE that beetroots do stain, so use a napkin or towel that you do not mind being stained.
Once cooled down, you can peel off the beetroot skin with your fingers as it should just come off easily. The steamed beetroot should weigh about 250 g as well.
Place the steamed, cooled, and peeled beets in a food processor, along with all the spices in the ingredients list (excluding the margarine).
Â½ tsp crushed chili flakes,Â½ green chili or red chili pepper,Â¼ tsp sea salt,Generous pinch of black pepper,Â½ tsp ground coriander or cumin,Â¼ tsp honey
Process until you have a rough-looking paste that still has small pieces of beetroot in it (i.e. not a smooth, fine paste).
The weight of this paste should be around 260 g (or at least 250 g).
In a large bowl, place the margarine and 250 g of the beet mixture and whisk together until you have a smooth deep pink / purple colored buttery spread. Taste and season with salt to taste.
170 g margarine
Scrape this into a bowl and set aside until needed.
Making the ribbon sandwiches (rainbow sandwiches)
Take four slices of bread and lay them out on your work surface.
40 slices soft white sandwich bread
Spread a thin layer of the carrot butter filling on one slice.
Spread a thin layer of the spinach butter filling on another slice.
Finally, spread a thin layer of the beet butter filling on the third slice.
Stack these three slices of bread on top of each other, along with the fourth slice on top. (You should have a sandwich that alternates with bread â€“ filling â€“ bread â€“ filling â€“ bread â€“ filling â€“ bread.)
You can stack them in any order you like in terms of the fillings. The filling shouldnâ€™t be too thick, just an even layer that is visible when the sandwich is cut (as you can see in the pictures in the post).
With a sharp knife, slice off the crusts to make a square sandwich. Cut this sandwich into four smaller sandwiches. This can be either 4 square sandwiches, 4 triangles, OR you can cut the sandwich lengthwise to make 4 finger sandwiches.
Repeat with all the slices of bread.
40 slices soft white sandwich bread
The sandwiches can now be served right away.
To store them for later (or leftovers), place the sandwiches in an air-tight container. Make sure the lid is not squishing the sandwiches.
Store the sandwiches for up to 4 days in the fridge. If you used butter instead of margarine, the butter will first need to soften at room temperature before you can serve them.",['Spinach  baby spinach half spinach and half romaine lettuce  parsley top stems and mostly leaves  green chili peppers serrano pepper  sea salt  Generous pepper  margarine butter Carrot  baby carrots carrots  turmeric  Generous black pepper  sea salt  ground coriander cumin  honey sugar  margarine butter Beetroot  beetroot  crushed chili akes adjust taste'],"Ingredients:

		Place a dry frying pan over a medium heat and stir in the Kashmiri chilli powder and curry powder. Let these spices roast for a few minutes, stirring often until they turn a deep chocolate brown. Transfer the roasted spice powder to a plate and set aside.Put the chicken in a large mixing bowl and season with the salt, pepper and soy sauce. Be sure to mix these ingredients right into the flesh of the meat. You can now go straight to cooking or leave it to marinate overnight.When ready to cook, heat the coconut oil in a large wok or pot over a medium-high heat. Add the cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods, chopped onion, chillies, garlic, ginger, pandan leaf and curry leaves and stir it all up.Continue frying for about 5 minutes or until the onion is just beginning to turn a golden brown and then stir in the ground turmeric and the prepared roasted curry powder and chilli powder blend.Pour in 250ml (1 cup) water and bring it all to a simmer. Then add the chicken and add a little more water if required. You want the water level to almost but not completely cover the chicken pieces. Add the Chinese chicken powder, if using.Cover the pan and continue cooking for about 10 minutes, by which time the meat should be just about cooked through.Then uncover the pan and let it all simmer gently for another 10 minutes or so to thicken the sauce. This is normally a dry curry with a thick sauce and the black sauce should coat the chicken.Season with salt and pepper to taste and enjoy with white rice or matta rice.

		Instructions
		Heat the oil over a medium high heat in a wok or large pan. When visibly hot, stir in the curry leaves and let them sizzle in the hot oil for about 30 seconds. The curry leaves should look shiny and be a bit crispy.Transfer the curry leaves to a plate with a slotted spoon and then add the garlic slivers to the same oil. Fry for about a minute or until the garlic is just beginning to brown. Transfer the garlic to the plate with the curry leaves.Now add the cashews to the hot oil. Be sure to stir continuously so that the cashews brown evening. In Sri Lanka, the cashews are deep fried so that they fry evenly. You can use less oil with this recipe but watch them carefully.Just before the cashews are finished cooking, stir in the ground turmeric.Transfer the browned cashews to a bowl lined with a few paper towels. Use the paper towels to soak up any excess oil. Then add the fried curry leaves and garlic, followed by the black pepper, chilli powder and salt to taste.Be sure to stir the nuts well so that they are equally coated with the other ingredients. Pour into a serving bowl and serve hot. You can also serve these warm or at room temperature but hot is best.

		Instructions
		Soak the lentils in water for at least six hours or overnight. After soaking the dried lentils will be so soft you can smash them between your fingers. Strain the lentils and place them in a food processor with the remaining vade ingredients up to and including the curry leaves. Do not add any water. Just blend the lentils and other ingredients to a paste. Wet your hands with water and take a small handful of the paste out and form it into a ball. Then flatten slightly and place a prawn in the centre, pressing down firmly so that it doesnâ€™t escape and go swimming when you place the vade in the oil. Repeat with the remaining paste and prawns.Begin heating about 5cm (2 inches) of oil in a wok or similar. It needs to be about 200c/400f. If you donâ€™t have an oil thermometer, place a wooded chopstick or spatula in the oil. If sizzling bubbles from around the wood instantaneously, your oil is ready for frying. Fry the vade in small batches so that you donâ€™t lower the temperature of the oil and fry, carefully splashing oil over the vade with a spoon until it is lightly browned and the prawn is cooked through. Repeat with the remaining vade.To serves, top with tamarind sauce or anything sauce you like really. I top my isso vade with hot sauce when I donâ€™t have any tamarind sauce on hand. I always have hot sauce in the cupboard. Then serve topped with salad vegetable to your liking

		Instructions
		Place the beef in a mixing bowl and add the cumin, chilli powder, black pepper, salt and broken up piece of real cinnamon.* Mix well with your hands so that the meat is equally coated and then pour in 250ml (1 cup) of water. Stir it all up and set aside to marinate for a few minutes or even overnight. The longer the better. When ready to cook the curry, heat the oil over medium high heat and stir in the garlic. Stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds and then add the sliced leek, curry leaves, red onion and fenugreek seeds. If using cassia instead of real cinnamon, it can be added to the oil at this stage too. Fry this veggie mixture for about 5 minutes to soften and flavour the oil and then pour in the marinated beef. Brown the beef in the oil for a couple of minutes and then pour in just enough water to cover. Place the lid on the pot and simmer over a medium heat for about 40 minutes or until the beef is good and tender. Donâ€™t rush this! Itâ€™s ready when itâ€™s ready. If needed, you can always add a drop more water if the sauce is drying up. Serve with white basmati rice or red matta rice.

		Instructions
		Place the aubergine pieces in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle with the ground turmeric and salt. Mix well to coat and allow to sit while you heat the oil. Heat about 5cm (2 inches) of vegetable oil in a large pan or wok until visibly hot and then add the eggplant (aubergine). You should do this in two or more batches to maintain the heat of the oil. Fry until golden brown and then transfer to paper towels to soak up any excess oil.  Fry the shallots in the same way but these should only be lightly browned to soften. Transfer these to paper towels too. You can discard the cooking oil.Wipe the pan clean and then place it back on a medium-high heat. Add the coconut oil and when it melts stir in the mustard seeds. When the mustard seeds begin to crackle, reduce the heat to medium and add the cinnamon, cardamom pods, curry leaves and the pandan leaves (if using). Infuse the ingredients into the oil for about 30 seconds and then add the chopped onion. Fry this for about five minutes or until the onion is soft and translucent and then stir in the garlic and ginger paste. Stir in the chillies and fry for 30 seconds and then add the remaining ingredients.Simmer the sauce for a minute or two and then taste it. It should be a nice combination of sweet, sour and spicy. At this stage you can adjust the flavour to taste by adding more sugar, vinegar or tamarind. If you think it is too spicy, just add more coconut milk. Once youâ€™re happy with the sauce, pour in the fried aubergines and shallots. Bring up to heat, stirring it all together to combine. Season with salt to taste and serve.

		Instructions
		Put the pork pieces in a mixing bowl and add the marinade ingredients. Mix well with your hands or a spoon. You might want to wear plastic gloves if mixing by hand because of the chilli powder. Cover and leave to marinate for 3 hours or overnight. The longer the better.Heat the oil in a large pot over medium high heat. When visibly hot, stir in the curry leaves and pandan leaves and allow them to infuse into the oil for about 30 seconds. Now add the chopped red onions and fry for about 5 minutes or until soft and translucent. Stir in the garlic and ginger paste, lemongrass and the chillies and fry for a further 30 seconds. Add the black curry powder and stir well to combine. Now pour in the marinade coated pork and stir until the meat is nicely coated with the other ingredients. Fry over medium heat for about 10 minutes to brown the pork and then add just enough water to cover the meat completely. Stir in the smashed garlic, sugar and tamarind concentrate and simmer, covered for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, lift the lid and take a look. This is a dry curry so if it is looking really saucy, cook a little longer until the delicious thick sauce is coating the meat. Taste the curry and add more sugar, for sweetness and tamarind for sourness to taste. Complete by adding salt to taste.

Take the beef and cut into medium-sized pieces. Rinse them well and keep aside.
Take the grinder and add black pepper, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, garlic cloves, ginger, and a little water. Also, get ready with turmeric powder and salt.
Grind them to smooth paste.
Now add turmeric powder, salt, and ground mixture to the beef.

Chop the onion, cut the green chilies by half, and crush the cinnamon. Also, get ready with curry leaves and cardamom. Besides, extract the thick coconut milk from grated coconut.
Slice the potatoes into medium size. Also, get ready with basmati rice.
Heat the oil, add cardamom and cinnamon. SautÃ© them for 10 to 20 seconds. I suggest you use a large non-stick cooking pot with a lid.
Now add the onions, curry leaves, and green chilies. Fry them under high flame until the onion starts to turn a golden color. Stir occasionally to avoid burn. For me, it takes about 3 minutes.
Add the marinated beef and mix them well. Cook covered under the high flame for 6 to 8 minutes.
Take off the lid and add potatoes. Now add the coconut milk and mix them well. Also, taste the curry and adjust salt if needed.
Cook covered under medium flame until you get a well-cooked beef with little gravy. For me, it takes about 15 minutes.
While you cook the beef, wash the basmati rice and boil it. It is enough to boil the rice for 90%.
Once the rice 90% done, strain the water and add all the rice on top of the beef curry. Spread it evenly.
Finally, cook covered under very low flame for 6 to 8 minutes.
Switch off the flame and mix everything well until all combined.

All purpose flour - 500g
Butter - 200g
Brown sugar - 175g
White sugar - 175g
Vanilla - 1 Â½ tablespoon
Baking powder - 1 teaspoon
Baking soda - 1 teaspoon
Salt - Â¾ teaspoon","INSTRUCTIONS
Take the large bowl and add the butter. Also add the white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla. The reason why I add the brown sugar is that brown sugar makes cookies moister and chewier than does white sugar.
Mix everything together until well blended. For me, it takes about 5 minutes.
Now add baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Add all purpose flour.
Mix everything together with your fingers and palm till totally combined. I did this process for about 5 minutes. You should mix them well enough. If not, the baking powder, baking soda, and salt wonâ€™t combine fully with the flour.
Now add the roasted peanuts and mix them up well.
Now take some mixture and make the ball. Place the ball in your palm and slightly flatten each ball. Do the same until you have done with all the mixture.
Greased the baking tray with a little butter and place them on it. Or else, you can place them on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake in a preheated 375 degrees (Fahrenheit) oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until the cookies get lightly brown.
