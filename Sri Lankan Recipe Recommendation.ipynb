      "Instructions: ['Making the cutlet mixtureBoil potatoes with Â¼ tsp turmeric and Â½ tsp salt. Drain when the potatoes are fork-tender and then leave them to cool down and dry out. Do not boil potatoes until they become mushy.And then mash them with a fork or a spoon.Heat 2 tsp oil. Add garlic, curry leaves, onion, and green chili. Make sure everything is finely chopped. Fry everything on medium heat until the onions become soft and dry.Then add 2 tsp of chili flakes. Mix well with the mixture.if(typeof ez_ad_units == \"undefined\"){ez_ad_units=[];}ez_ad_units.push([[336,280],\"hungrylankan_com-banner-1\",\"ezslot_15\",912,\"0\",\"0\", \"hungrylankan_com-banner-1-0\"]);if(typeof __ez_fad_position == \"function\"){__ez_fad_position(\"div-gpt-ad-hungrylankan_com-banner-1-0\");}Move everything aside and add the mackerel can (completely drained) Mash them with your spoon until there are no chunks left. Alternatively, you can mash them before you add them to the pan too.Add 1/4tsp turmeric and salt to your taste. Mix well.Then add your mashed potatoes and black pepper. Mix well, taste, and adjust salt and pepper if needed.Finally, add lime juice. Adjust seasonings to your taste. Mix everything really well together until the mixture becomes quite lumpy. Leave the cutlet mixture to cool down.When the mixture is cooled down, take 2-3 tbsp of the cutlet mixture (depending on how big or small you want) at a time and make them into small cutlet balls. Make sure the surface of the cutlet ball is smooth. (read the description for more info). Arrange them on a plate.if(typeof ez_ad_units == \"undefined\"){ez_ad_units=[];}ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],\"hungrylankan_com-large-leaderboard-2\",\"ezslot_23\",913,\"0\",\"0\", \"hungrylankan_com-large-leaderboard-2-0\"]);if(typeof __ez_fad_position == \"function\"){__ez_fad_position(\"div-gpt-ad-hungrylankan_com-large-leaderboard-2-0\");}Breading and fryingMake a lump-free batter by mixing flour, salt, and water together. You may need to adjust the amount of water that goes in. The batter should be thick and it should coat the cutlet balls really well. If the batter is too runny then add more flour. If the batter is too thick, then add some water.Now dip one ball at a time in the batter. Use a fork to easily handle. Hold the cutlet over the mixture for a few seconds so the excessive batter can drip down.Transfer it to the breadcrumbs plate and cover the cutlet completely with breadcrumbs.Roll the cutlet between your hands so the breadcrumbs stick to the cutlet better. If you use very fine breadcrumbs make sure to double coat the cutlets by dipping them again in the batter and cover with breadcrumbs.if(typeof ez_ad_units == \"undefined\"){ez_ad_units=[];}ez_ad_units.push([[300,250],\"hungrylankan_com-leader-1\",\"ezslot_18\",914,\"0\",\"0\", \"hungrylankan_com-leader-1-0\"]);if(typeof __ez_fad_position == \"function\"){__ez_fad_position(\"div-gpt-ad-hungrylankan_com-leader-1-0\");}Arrange the cutlets on a plate and refrigerate them for about 1 hour or until youâ€™re ready to fry them. Let the batter dry out so the breadcrumbs stick to the cutlets better.Heat the oil (350F). When you put a piece of breadcrumb coated batter it should bubble up and quickly reach the surface of the oil when your oil is heated enough. Add about 3 cutlets at a time into the hot oil. Leave the cutlets for about 20 seconds untouched. And then roll/flip them carefully from time to time to ensure that they evenly fry. When the cutlets are golden, lay them on a paper towel to remove excess oil. (Read the description for more info about frying cutlets.)']\n",
