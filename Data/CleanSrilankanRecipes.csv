Chicken cheese bites with Habanero (Kochchi Bites),['chicken potatoes cheddar cheese garlic onion chili akes habanero panko bread crumbs Salt Mozzarella cubes breading frying Thick batter made water salt Bread crumbs needed Oil'],"['Making filling and the balls\nMix everything except mozzarella cubes in the â€œfillingâ€\x9d list together in a food processor until you get a crumbly paste. If you donâ€™t have a food processor, grind the habanero first in a mortar and pestle and add that to everything else and mix with your hands. Make sure to use kitchen gloves.\nMake lime size balls. These do not have to be perfectly round. Now flat teach ball into a disc-like shape. Put a mozzarella cube in. Fold the edges of the disc inside and completely cover the mozzarella cube with the meat filling.\nRoll between your palms to make it into a tight ball. No air should be left inside. Oil your hands if the filling sticks on to hands.The surface of the ball should be smooth. And the meat filling should cover the mozzarella cube completely. You can Make 10 balls out of the amount I have given above.\nBreading:\nMake a thick batter using some flour water and salt. Or you could use beaten eggs too. Arrange bread crumbs in a separate container. Then dip one ball at a time in the batter. Use a fork for this for easier handling. Then roll it on bread crumbs and cover the balls evenly. Gently press breadcrumbs with your hands to the ball to ensure that they stick to the ball. Do this to all the balls and lay them on a plate.\nDo this breading process one more time with all the balls. Double coating is so important in this recipe.\nThen arrange all the breaded balls on a plate with some space in between and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. This helps dry out the batter so the breadcrumbs adhere better to the meatball. This process also dries out the surface of the balls, which makes it quicker to fry.\nFrying\nHeat oil in a deep pan or fryer. Add a generous amount of oil for deep frying. Fry the chicken cheese balls until they are golden brown. Keep turning them frequently in the oil to get even browning.

Crispy Chicken rolls with Habanero and cheese,['chicken potatoes cheddar cheese habanero chili garlic onion chili akes salt needed Pancake batter milk water'],"[""Make the filling\n\nGrind the habaneros and green chili into a paste using your mortar and pestle. If you donâ€™t have one, cut it super finely. Please use kitchen gloves! this stuff is really hot! Definitely cut down the amount of habanero you use if you have kids or donâ€™t like hot food. Then mix everything together for the filling in a bowl. Or pulse a few times in a food processor.\n\nMake the pancakes\nWhisk flour, milk, and water together to form a smooth batter. If the batter is thick, add more water, a little at a time, and whisk. There should be no lumps in the batter. You can use a blender to mix this too. Heat a small nonstick pan. I use a nonstick hopper pan. add a drop of oil and rub it all over the pan using a paper towel. you just need a super-thin coating of oil. Pour the batter using a large spoon or a ladle and swirl the pan in a circular motion so the batter can spread throughout the pan evenly. Pancake has to be very thin so donâ€™t put too much batter. Cover and cook for about a minute until itâ€™s cooked but still flexible. Do not wait until they get crispy. (If you got any leftover pancake batter, do not throw away. Use it for Breading.)\nWrap the rolls\nNow put the pancake on a plate. Put about 3 tbsp of filling and fold three side edges to the middle and roll it over to make a cylindrical shape roll. Make sure you dust with some flour to avoid them from sticking together. Go to my fish rolls recipe to see the step by step photos on wrapping.\nBreading\nDip a roll in the batter, lift and let the excess batter fall back in and then place in the breadcrumbs. Use tongs for easy handling. Cover well with breadcrumbs. Put on a clean dry plate. Do this to one roll at a time. Repeat the breading process one more time. Since you put cheese in the filling it's important to have a nice thick coating. After double-breading, put them in the fridge to dry out for about two hours or so. This dries out the batter you used for breading which ensures they keep in place. You can fry them whenever you want. But make sure they are nicely dried.\nFrying\nHeat oil in a deep fryer or in a pan. When the oil is hot, fry rolls until they are golden brown. You have to fry them as quickly as possible to avoid bursting. Make sure you flip them frequently. And donâ€™t overcrowd the pan. I only fry about two rolls at a time. Serve hot when the cheese inside is still soft and melted.""]","['For the Filling\n2 cup finely shredded chicken\n1 1â\x81„2 cup boiled potatoes mashed with a fork\n1 cup sharp cheddar cheese shredded\n2 habanero / (à¶±à¶ºà·’ à¶¸à·’à¶»à·’à·ƒà·Š)\n1 green chili ((optional))\n1 tsp garlic powder\n1 tsp onion powder\n1 tsp chili flakes ((optional))\nsalt as needed\nFor Pancake batter\n240 g flour\n1â\x81„2 cup milk\n1 1â\x81„2 cup water, (you may need more)\n1â\x81„2 tsp salt\nFor breading and frying\noil for deep frying\na thick batter made with flour and water\nbread crumbs as needed']"

And lift and hold it to remove any excess dripping batter. Transfer the eggroll to the breadcrumb plate, and coat well with breadcrumbs. Lift the roll and shake to remove any excess breadcrumbs and pat with your hand so that breadcrumbs stick to the pancake very well. Place it back on the tray/plate. If the breadcrumbs you're using are very fine and powdery, do this coating process one more time to double coat the egg rolls.\nNow if you have time, refrigerate the egg rolls in the fridge for about an hour or up until you're ready to fry them. If you're out of time, at least let them rest until the batter you use to coat dries out. As the batter dries out, the breadcrumbs stick to the pancake pretty nicely.\nHeat oil in a deep vessel/pot. put a piece of a batter+breadcrumb piece and see if it floats immediately. If it floats then the oil is ready. Fry the egg rolls in hot oil. Make sure to flip them frequently to ensure even heat distribution. Also, be generous with the oil. Do not overcrowd the pan as the rolls drop the oil temp significantly. And add one roll at a time and let it fry for about 30 seconds before you add the next one.

And also tiny frothy pieces that have tiny bubbles.\nNow add softened (almost melted) butter, salt, and flour.\nKnead the dough in the mixer for about 10 mins until the dough is smooth and stretchy. If the dough seems dry and hard, and a tiny bit of water, about a tsp at a time. (Some flour brands absorb more water than others) The dough has to be nonstick, smooth, stretchy, and pliable. If you hand knead this, knead about 20mins or until you get a cohesive, nonstick smooth and stretchy dough.\nTake the dough out from the mixer bowl, knead for a minute and shape it to a ball. lightly grease a bowl with some butter.

Repeat this process with all the balls.\nLet the filled dough balls rise again about 50% - 75% of their size. This won't take time as much as it took for the first rise. For me, it usually takes about 30mins. This could be vary depending on the temperature of your house. Do not let them rise too much, they will collapse in the oven and you'll get wrinkles on the top, and buns would be dry.

Sri Lankan Meatball Curry,['Chicken meatball mix ground chicken'],"["":Chicken meatballsPlace all the ingredients in a large bowl.

Take care to mix it all in one direction, to make the mixture sticky.When mixed properly, the ground meat will become sticky (almost like dumpling filling). This will ensure you have nicely formed meatballs that will be juicy and not crumble when cooked.To form the meat into meatballs, have a bowl of cold tap water close by so you can wet your hands and utensils which will prevent the meat from sticking to them.Use a cookie scoop or spoon to portion the meat mixture. I use a 2 tbsp cookie scoop. Take each portion and gently form it into a smooth ball by rolling it in your hands. Make sure your hands are wet, so that the meat doesn't stick. You should be able to get about 30 meatballs. Let the meatballs sit for at least 30 minutes to marinate. This is optional, but I like to marinate them if I have time.

Roti Canai Recipe,[' all about'],"[':About 10 hours before you want to cook the roti (or at least 3 hours)In a large bowl, place the flour and salt. Stir to combine.500 g all purpose flour, 1 tsp sea saltWhile stirring the flour with a fork or spatula, add the hot water to form clumps in the flour. Stir until the water is dispersed throughout the dough (forming smaller clumps).180 mL boiling waterAdd the room temperature water while mixing (preferably with your hands), until you form a scraggly dough. The dough should be fairly soft, but not sticky.180 mL room temperature waterOnce you form a rough dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This helps to develop gluten, so you can also leave covered upto 1 hour for more gluten development. After 30 minutes, the dough should have absorbed all of the water well, and softened a little bit. Knead this dough for about 2 â€“ 3 minutes to form a dough with a smooth, satiny surface. Knead longer if needed until the dough has a smooth surface. Weigh the dough, and divide it into 8 equal portions (about 90 â€“ 100 g per portion). Shape each dough portion into a smooth dough ball. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.Keep a small bowl and a large plate (or flat container) ready. Place some vegetable oil in the bowl. Spread some oil on the bottom of the large plate / flat container as well.OilRoll the dough balls in the oil to coat. Place each coated dough ball on the plate. Make sure there is at least Â½ inch space between the dough balls if possible (otherwise they will stick to each other).Cover with plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for at least 2 hours, or up to 12 hours. I prefer to let the dough rest for at least 2 hours (they are more pliable this way) if I\'m in a  hurry, OR overnight whenever possible.\n\n  \n      \n        \n        \n        \n      \n    \n\nShaping the roti canaiPlace some oil (or butter and ghee) in a bowl.Oil, Butter or gheeTake one dough ball and flatten it out on a smooth work surface. Use your hands to stretch out the dough until they are paper thin, and you can see through the dough.TIP â€“ To stretch the dough, flatten the dough with your palm to get a circle / square shape. Press one end of the dough onto your work surface, so that it lightly sticks to the surface. Then gently stretch the opposite end of the dough. Repeat all around, so that you stretch out the dough evenly. It can be a circle or rectangle in shape. Try your best not to tear the roti. This takes practice, but with more experience, you will get fewer and fewer tears. Spread some oil (or butter or ghee) on the surface of the roti. Donâ€™t make this layer of fat too thick.Roll up the dough into a tube. Make sure you roll up the dough firmly into a log. Alternatively, you can gather the dough from either end in 0.5 â€“ 1 inch folds that are on top of each other (see the panel of images in the post â€“ ""the roti after folding"").Once you have rolled up / folded the dough, coil the dough into a spiral (see pictures in the post). Make sure the spiral is tightly coiled. Also make sure to tuck the ends of the dough under the spiral, and then press down the spiral with your palm. This should hopefully help seal the spiral/coil.Place this on the plate again (with some oil at the bottom). Repeat with the rest of the dough portions.Cover the dough with plastic wrap, and let it rest for at least another hour.Cooking the roti canaiPlease note that the heat recommended for cooking the roti can vary from stove to stove. So adjust the heat accordingly.Use at least an 8 inch non-stick pan (or tawa). Heat over medium heat.Once the pan is heated, place one portion of the coiled roti on your work surface and flatten it out into a 6 â€“ 7 inch roti using your hands. You can use a rolling pin as well, but I personally prefer to use my hands.Add a few drops of oil into the pan, or brush the surface of the pan with some oil. Place the roti in the pan and cook until golden brown. Flip the roti and cook until the other side is also golden brown and cooked through. The total cook time (for me) is about 4 minutes per roti. I flip the roti throughout the cooking process to ensure even browning on both sides.Place the cooked roti on a cooling rack. While itâ€™s still hot, use your hands to squash the roti (kind of in a clapping motion). This helps separate the layers in the cooked roti.Repeat with all of the dough portions.Serve while warm, with curry, or however you like!']","[':â–¢ 500 g all purpose flour about 4 cups of flour, measured by spoon and level methodâ–¢ 1 tsp sea saltâ–¢ 180 mL boiling water Â¾ cupâ–¢ 180 mL room temperature water Â¾ cupâ–¢ Oil for coating, layering, and cookingâ–¢ Butter or ghee optional']"

Whisk for a further 2 â€“ 3 minutes until you have a light, fluffy, soft, spreadable frosting.500 â€“ 567 g confectionerâ€™s sugarIf the frosting is too stiff, you can add extra cream (1 tbsp at a time) to get an even softer buttercream. If you want the buttercream to have a stronger coffee flavor, you can also dissolve any extra coffee granules into 1 tbsp of water and whisk in that as well.Assembling the cakeLevel the top of the cake layers (if they are domed).Place one cake layer on a cake serving plate or decorating plate. Make sure the bottom of the cake is facing down.Place about Â¾ cup of the frosting on top of this cake layer and spread it evenly. You can add more or less of the frosting as you like.Now place the second cake layer on top. Make sure the bottom of the cake is facing up this time, so that you have a level surface on top to frost. Gently press the cake down to make sure the cake layer sticks to the buttercream below.Apply a thin coating of the frosting to completely cover the cake. This is the crumb coating. The crumb coating will help make the sides and top of the cake even, and make it easier to frost the final layer of buttercream.Allow the crumb coating to set in the fridge (or a cool place in your kitchen) for a few minutes.Evenly spread the rest of the frosting over the cake. Use an offset spatula to create swirls for an old fashioned cake look, OR use a bench scraper or spatula to smooth out the frosting.DecorationDecorate the cake however you like. Here, I applied one strip of soft chocolate fudge sauce inside a pastry bag, and then filled the pastry bag with the coffee buttercream.

Use a dough hook or wooden spoon to mix the ingredients until combined. You can use the paddle attachment in your mixer to do this as well.With a kneading hook, knead the dough for about 5 minutes. The dough should be soft and slightly tacky (not sticky). If the dough is too dry, you can add the extra water, 1 tbsp at a time, while kneading the dough.Add the 2 tbsp butter or oil and knead for a further 5 â€“ 10 minutes, until you have a smooth, soft, tacky dough.Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with plastic wrap.

OR you can roll the dough into a log with even thickness, and cut it into 12 equal sections.Gently knead each portion to form a smooth ball (about 45 sec â€“ 1 min, donâ€™t over-knead the dough).To make the Beef BunsLine 1 half sheet pan, and 1 quarter sheet pan with parchment paper.Flatten each dough ball into a circle using your hands. With your fingers, pinch the edges to create a thinner edge than in the center.Place the dough circle in the cupped palm of your hand. Take 2 heaping teaspoons (regular teaspoon, NOT measuring teaspoons) of the spicy beef filling and press it gently into the middle of the dough (the dough will stretch out slightly as you do this).Stretch the edges of the dough over the filling, and pinch the edges together to seal in the filling. When this is done, gently roll the bread roll in your hands to make it smooth and to properly seal the roll (see pictures in the post).Place the buns on the sheet pans with the sealed side down. Space them out well.

Add the tomato ketchup and green chili peppers (serrano peppers) and mix through and cook for a further 5 â€“ 10 minutes.Season with salt if needed (remember you are using brined mackerel, and may not need a lot of salt).Mash the potatoes slightly (with some small whole pieces left intact), and add this to the fish mix. Mix well. Sprinkle the lime juice over the fish and potatoes and mix well. Season and add more lime juice and salt if necessary.Let the mix cool down.AssemblyRoll out the cool patties dough on a lightly floured smooth surface. Roll out until the dough is about 3 mm thick. To ensure the dough doesnâ€™t stick to the surface, lightly dust the surface and flip the dough over half way through rolling. This will help prevent shrinking of the dough and itâ€™ll roll out better too. Make sure the rolled out dough isnâ€™t sticking to the surface before cutting the patties dough wrappers as well.Cut 3 â€“ 3.5 inch diameter circles using a pastry cutter. Set these aside in one layer and cover with plastic wrap. Re-roll the scraps and cut more pastry circles. You should get approximately 15 â€“ 17 wrappers.Take one dough wrapper, and with your fingers, flatten it out slightly at the edges to create a slightly bigger circle (especially if the wrappers shrink a little).Take a spoonful of the fish filling and form a ball thatâ€™s about  1 Â½ inches in diameter. Place this in the middle of the wrapper.Apply water along the edge of one half of the wrapper. Carefully fold over the other half of the wrapper over the filling toward the moistened edge and press down to seal. Use your fingers to form a seal along the edge, and then use a fork to crimp the edges.Transfer the patties to a plate and cover with a plastic wrap. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers.To FryHeat enough oil to deep fry the fish patties (about 3 â€“ 4 inches), or to shallow fry (about 1 Â½ â€“ 2 inches).Once the oil is heated to 350Â°F / 180Â°C, fry the patties in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.The patties should fry for about 2  minutes until they turn golden brown in the center and slightly darker at the edges (about 1 minute per side if shallow frying). If you are frying the patties from frozen, they need to deep fry for about 3 â€“ 4 minutes until they turn golden brown in the center and slightly darker at the edges.Place the fried patties on paper towels to drain the excess oil.Serve while warm or at room temperature with tomato ketchup or chili sauce.

Let the crepe batter sit at room temperature, covered, for about 15 â€“ 30 minutes to rest.WITHOUT A BLENDER â€“ place all the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk all the wet ingredients together in a jug.Create a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and slowly pour the wet ingredient mix, while whisking. After adding half of the liquid, whisk the mix to ensure there are no lumps. Add the rest of the liquid and whisk until smooth. Let it rest, covered, for 15 â€“ 30 minutes until you are ready to use it.MAKING THE CREPES â€“ heat a 6 inch or 8 inch non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Brush some oil on the surface of the pan when itâ€™s hot.Pour Â¼ cup of the batter into the hot pan, while swirling, to evenly coat the surface of the pan. The batter will create bubbles on the surface if it's hot enough (this is characteristic of Sri Lankan crepes, but it's optional). Cover any big holes with some loose batter.Cook for about 30 seconds, until the edges turn golden brown in color.Loosen the crepe and flip it over, and cook for a further 15 â€“ 30 seconds.Both sides should be golden to dark golden brown in color.Flip the crepes over on to a plate and stack them on top of each other until you have cooked all the crepes.Once all the crepes are cooked, cover the stack with a clean cloth and let it cool.A NOTE ABOUT THE CREPES â€“ if the pan is not as hot, the crepes will take a little longer to cook, and the surface will be smooth (no bubbles), but still go ahead and flip the crepe when the edges start to brown. These will then look more like French crepes. The number of crepes you make will depend on the size of the pan as well.AssemblySpread about 2 tbsp of the coconut filling in the center of each cooled crepe. Fold one end over the filling. Fold the edges in and roll up the crepe roll to form a log/roll â€“ similar to how spring rolls are rolled up.Place the crepes on a plate, with the seam side down.

Sri Lankan Black Chicken Curry,['Kashmiri chilli good quality curry bite sized chicken'],"['Place a dry frying pan over a medium heat and stir in the Kashmiri chilli powder and curry powder. Let these spices roast for a few minutes, stirring often until they turn a deep chocolate brown. Transfer the roasted spice powder to a plate and set aside.Put the chicken in a large mixing bowl and season with the salt, pepper and soy sauce. Be sure to mix these ingredients right into the flesh of the meat. You can now go straight to cooking or leave it to marinate overnight.When ready to cook, heat the coconut oil in a large wok or pot over a medium-high heat. Add the cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods, chopped onion, chillies, garlic, ginger, pandan leaf and curry leaves and stir it all up.Continue frying for about 5 minutes or until the onion is just beginning to turn a golden brown and then stir in the ground turmeric and the prepared roasted curry powder and chilli powder blend.Pour in 250ml (1 cup) water and bring it all to a simmer. Then add the chicken and add a little more water if required. You want the water level to almost but not completely cover the chicken pieces. Add the Chinese chicken powder, if using.Cover the pan and continue cooking for about 10 minutes, by which time the meat should be just about cooked through.Then uncover the pan and let it all simmer gently for another 10 minutes or so to thicken the sauce. This is normally a dry curry with a thick sauce and the black sauce should coat the chicken.Season with salt and pepper to taste and enjoy with white rice or matta rice.']","['2 tbsp Kashmiri chilli powder\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 tbsp good quality curry powder]\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 kg (1 1/4lb) small bite sized chicken pieces, skin removed and preferably on the bone\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 tsp black pepper\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 tsp salt\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 tbsp light soy sauce\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4 tbsp coconut oil\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 cinnamon stick, broken into small pieces, or cassia left whole\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4 cloves\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 cardamon pods, lightly bruised\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tÂ½ medium red onion, finely chopped\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 green chillies, cut lengthwise\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5 cloves garlic, finely chopped\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 x 2.5cm (1 inch) ginger, finely chopped\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 small pieces of pandan leaves, about 7.5cm (3 inches) square total\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t20 curry leaves\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tÂ½ tsp ground turmeric\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 tsp Chinese chicken powder (optional but it adds a nice flavour)\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSalt and pepper to taste']"

Strain the lentils and place them in a food processor with the remaining vade ingredients up to and including the curry leaves. Do not add any water. Just blend the lentils and other ingredients to a paste. Wet your hands with water and take a small handful of the paste out and form it into a ball. Then flatten slightly and place a prawn in the centre, pressing down firmly so that it doesnâ€™t escape and go swimming when you place the vade in the oil. Repeat with the remaining paste and prawns.Begin heating about 5cm (2 inches) of oil in a wok or similar. It needs to be about 200c/400f. If you donâ€™t have an oil thermometer, place a wooded chopstick or spatula in the oil. If sizzling bubbles from around the wood instantaneously, your oil is ready for frying. Fry the vade in small batches so that you donâ€™t lower the temperature of the oil and fry, carefully splashing oil over the vade with a spoon until it is lightly browned and the prawn is cooked through. Repeat with the remaining vade.To serves, top with tamarind sauce or anything sauce you like really. I top my isso vade with hot sauce when I donâ€™t have any tamarind sauce on hand.

Stir it all up and set aside to marinate for a few minutes or even overnight. The longer the better. When ready to cook the curry, heat the oil over medium high heat and stir in the garlic. Stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds and then add the sliced leek, curry leaves, red onion and fenugreek seeds. If using cassia instead of real cinnamon, it can be added to the oil at this stage too. Fry this veggie mixture for about 5 minutes to soften and flavour the oil and then pour in the marinated beef. Brown the beef in the oil for a couple of minutes and then pour in just enough water to cover. Place the lid on the pot and simmer over a medium heat for about 40 minutes or until the beef is good and tender. Donâ€™t rush this! Itâ€™s ready when itâ€™s ready. If needed, you can always add a drop more water if the sauce is drying up.

Eggplant Curry,['aubergines'],"['Place the aubergine pieces in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle with the ground turmeric and salt. Mix well to coat and allow to sit while you heat the oil. Heat about 5cm (2 inches) of vegetable oil in a large pan or wok until visibly hot and then add the eggplant (aubergine). You should do this in two or more batches to maintain the heat of the oil. Fry until golden brown and then transfer to paper towels to soak up any excess oil.  Fry the shallots in the same way but these should only be lightly browned to soften. Transfer these to paper towels too. You can discard the cooking oil.Wipe the pan clean and then place it back on a medium-high heat. Add the coconut oil and when it melts stir in the mustard seeds. When the mustard seeds begin to crackle, reduce the heat to medium and add the cinnamon, cardamom pods, curry leaves and the pandan leaves (if using). Infuse the ingredients into the oil for about 30 seconds and then add the chopped onion. Fry this for about five minutes or until the onion is soft and translucent and then stir in the garlic and ginger paste. Stir in the chillies and fry for 30 seconds and then add the remaining ingredients.Simmer the sauce for a minute or two and then taste it. It should be a nice combination of sweet, sour and spicy. At this stage you can adjust the flavour to taste by adding more sugar, vinegar or tamarind. If you think it is too spicy, just add more coconut milk. Once youâ€™re happy with the sauce, pour in the fried aubergines and shallots. Bring up to heat, stirring it all together to combine.

You might want to wear plastic gloves if mixing by hand because of the chilli powder. Cover and leave to marinate for 3 hours or overnight. The longer the better.Heat the oil in a large pot over medium high heat. When visibly hot, stir in the curry leaves and pandan leaves and allow them to infuse into the oil for about 30 seconds. Now add the chopped red onions and fry for about 5 minutes or until soft and translucent. Stir in the garlic and ginger paste, lemongrass and the chillies and fry for a further 30 seconds. Add the black curry powder and stir well to combine. Now pour in the marinade coated pork and stir until the meat is nicely coated with the other ingredients. Fry over medium heat for about 10 minutes to brown the pork and then add just enough water to cover the meat completely. Stir in the smashed garlic, sugar and tamarind concentrate and simmer, covered for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, lift the lid and take a look. This is a dry curry so if it is looking really saucy, cook a little longer until the delicious thick sauce is coating the meat. Taste the curry and add more sugar, for sweetness and tamarind for sourness to taste. Complete by adding salt to taste.']","['900g (2 lbs) belly pork, cut into bite sized pieces\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFOR THE MARINADE\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 tsp red chilli powder* (or to taste)\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tÂ½ tsp ground turmeric\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 tbsp ground black pepper\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t70ml (1/4 cup) distilled white vinegar\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 tbsp garlic and ginger paste\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 tsp salt\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFOR THE CURRY\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 tbsp coconut oil or rapeseed (canola) oil\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t20 fresh or frozen curry leaves\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 x 5cm x 5cm (2â€\x9d x 2â€\x9d) pandan leaf (optional)\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 medium red onions, finely chopped\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 tbsp garlic and ginger paste\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 lemongrass stalk, white part only, cut into about 8 pieces\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3 tbsp dark roasted curry powder (see page 00) or another good quality curry powder\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5 green birdâ€™s eye chillies, slit lengthwise down the middle\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 whole head of garlic, smashed but left in the skins\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 tsp jaggery or light brown sugar\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 tsp tamarind concentrate']"
